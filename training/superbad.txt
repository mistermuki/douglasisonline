Cut to black. "Too Hot To Stop" by The Bar-Kays starts playing.

OPENING CREDITS

CUT TO: EXT. STREET - MORNING

Cut to Seth driving. He calls Evan. Cut to Evan�s kitchen. Evan answers his phone. Scene cuts back and forth between the car and the kitchen.

EVAN: Yo.

SETH: Hey, man. I was doing research for next year, and I think I figured out which website I wanna subscribe to. The Vag-Tastic Voyage.

EVAN: Which one is the Vag-Tastic Voyage?

SETH: The Vag-Tastic voyage is the one where they find, like, random girls on the street, and they invite them into a van, and then they bang them once they�re on the van. It�s like thirteen bucks a month, and you get access to a bunch of other sites. Like one's Latina, one's Asian, um, you know, there's one for fetishes, like feet and pee-pee and shit and stuff like that.

EVAN: That's disgusting. You're like an animal.

SETH: I'm� what? I'm disgusting? You're the weird one, man. Don't make me feel weird 'cause I like porn. You're the weird one for not liking porn. I'm normal as shit.

EVAN: Peeing on people. That's normal?

SETH: Evan, I'm not saying I'm gonna look at it. I'm just saying it comes with the site, okay? I don't know what I'm gonna be into ten years from now.

EVAN: I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff, you know? I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar, I want a little production value, you know? Like some editing, transition, something. Some music.

SETH: Yeah, you know, well, I'm sorry, Evan, that the Coen brothers don't direct the porn that I watch. They're hard to get a hold of, okay?

EVAN: Plus your parents are gonna be looking at the bill, dipshit.

Seth pulls into Evan's driveway.

SETH: Yeah, you're right. I probably should pick the one with the least dirty sounding name.

Evan exits his house.

EVAN: Uh, what about, like, Perfect Ten? Something like that, you know?

They hang up and continue the conversation in person. Evan gets in the car.

EVAN: Like Perfect Ten? Because that could be any number of things, you know? They can't really get you for that. That could be, like, a bowling website.

SETH: Yeah, but they don't really show dick going in, which is a huge concern.

EVAN: I didn't realize that.

SETH: Plus, have you ever seen a vagina by itself? Not for me.

Evan�s mom comes outside.

JANE: Hi. Thanks for taking him, Seth.

SETH: No, no problem, Jane. How are you?

JANE: Good.

SETH: Beautiful.

Evan reaches for the radio. Seth slaps his hand away.

SETH: Hey, don't touch that.

EVAN: What are you...? I'm not a piece of meat.

JANE: You two are funny. I can't imagine what you're gonna do without each other next year. Evan told me you didn't get into Dartmouth.

SETH: I got into some schools, some pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.

JANE: You gonna miss each other?

EVAN: No. Miss each other? No, thank you. I don't, I don't miss each other.

SETH: Yeah, I'm gonna cry myself to sleep every night.

EVAN: Me too.

SETH: When I'm out partying.

JANE: Go to school, boys.

She walks away.

EVAN: Bye, Mom.

SETH: Bye, Jane. I am truly jealous you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.

EVAN: Yeah, well, at least you got to suck on your dad's dick.

CUT TO: EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

"Soul Finger" by The Bar-Kays plays. The camera pans from a school bus to a shot of the school. Cut to Seth pulling into the parking lot.

EVAN: Hey, Seth, you can't park in the faculty lot.

SETH: Don't be such a vagine, man. I gotta get a Red Bull before class.

Cut to the pair approaching a store.

EVAN: You know, you're being an idiot, man. You shouldn't have parked there.

SETH: Fuck it. I'm about to graduate. They should be sucking on my ballsack. It's the least they could do for stealing three years of my life.

Cut to inside the store. Seth picks up a copy of an adult magazine.

SETH: Oh, fuck me.

EVAN: Look at those nipples.

SETH: They're like little baby toes.

EVAN: It's just not fair they get to flaunt that stuff, you know? And I have to hide every erection I get.

SETH: You know what I do? I flip my boner up into my waistband. It hides it and it feels awesome. I almost blew a load into my belly button.

EVAN: I mean, just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and stuff, and just, like, wanted to see them. That's the world I one day wanna live in.

SETH: You know it's been, like, two years since I've seen an actual human female nipple?

They begin walking around the store.

EVAN: Shauna? Shauna was two years ago now?

SETH: Yeah.

EVAN: Yeah, I guess so. But she was insanely hot.

SETH: Exactly. She was too hot, okay? That's what sucks.

EVAN: How can that possibly suck? I'd be psyched if I got with her. You got, like, two dozen handjobs.

SETH: Yes, and three-quarters of a blowjob, but who's counting, Evan? Look, it was the peak of my ass-getting career, and it happened way, way too early.

EVAN: You're like Orson Welles.

SETH: Exactly! If I'd paced myself, I'd be having at least steady sex with a decent-looking girl. I honestly see now why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.

EVAN: Well, you'll have sex in college, everyone does.

SETH: Yes, but the point is to be good at sex by the time you get to college. You don't want girls thinking you suck dick at fucking pussy, okay.

EVAN: I still think you have a chance with Jules, man, really. And she got incredibly hot over last summer, and she obviously hasn't realized it yet because she's still always talking to you and flirting with you and stuff.

SETH: Are you out of your mind? Look at Jules' dating record, okay? She dated Dan Remick, who's had a six-pack since, like, kindergarten. Jason Stone, who looks like fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir. Matt Muir. He's the sweetest guy ever. Have you ever stared into his eyes? It was like the first time I heard the Beatles. Why would she end her high school career with me?

EVAN: You know, Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz for like two years.

They put their items on the store counter.

SETH: Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot. You're actually a step up from that dick-load. That's why you need to stop being- will you get this for me?

He gestures towards his Red Bull.

SETH: That's why you need to stop being a pussy and nail her, okay?

Evan hands his money to the clerk.

SETH: You could bang her for like two months before you leave. And I'm not gonna dance around it, she looks like a good fucker.

EVAN: All right, I'm tired of you talking about her like that, man.

SETH: What, you can talk about her all day every day and the second I say one thing, it's like blasphemy?

EVAN: Yeah, well, I don't constantly insult her.

They leave the store.

SETH: I'm not trying to insult her. I'm just saying that she looks like a good fucker, okay? She looks like she can take a dick. Some women pride themselves on their dick-taking abilities.

EVAN: Dick-taking abilities? You think that's good to say about someone?

SETH: The fucked-up thing is, I actually do, okay? If some woman tried to compliment me on
my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.

As they walk away from the store, Jesse gets their attention.

JESSE: Hey, yo, Seth.

SETH: What?

JESSE: Did you hear I'm having a big grad party next Saturday?

SETH: No.

JESSE: Yeah.

Jesse spits on Seth.

GUY: Oh, shit!

JESSE: You're not coming. Tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either.

Seth and Evan start walking again.

SETH: So Jesse wanted me to tell you you're a fucking faggot and can't come to his party.

EVAN: You really bitched out back there, man.

SETH: I bitched out? You bitched out, man, you fucking Judas. You fucking left me hanging over there.

EVAN: Did you want me to dive in front of his spit?

CUT TO: EXT. TRACK - MORNING

Seth runs on the school�s track. He falls behind the rest of his class.

SETH: This is bullshit.

Another student passes Seth.

GUY: Pussy.

CUT TO: INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

As a teacher writes something on the board, Evan looks back at Becca. She catches him staring. He pretends to look elsewhere.

TEACHER: If i equals the square root of negative one then i squared equals negative one. Okay? In other words, if you consider i as a constant, you can then define the square roots of all the negative numbers. So i is an imaginary number. It doesn't really exist. If i equals the square root of negative one, then i squared equals negative one. Is this making-

The bell rings.

TEACHER: Okay.

Everyone gets up to leave class. Cut to the hallway outside.

GABY: Okay, bye.

Gaby walks away. Becca catches up to Evan.

BECCA: Evan! Evan, hey.

EVAN: Hey, Becca.

BECCA: Hey, thank you for your pen.

EVAN: Oh, no problem. No, no, don't worry. No worries. You just keep it. You won't have to borrow one again because you'll have that one.

BECCA: Thank you so much.

EVAN: You're welcome. Don't worry about it.

BECCA: So I was gonna ask you, did you hear about Jesse's grad party next weekend? It should be fun.

EVAN: I heard, I� It's a maybe.

BECCA: Really?

EVAN: For me at the moment. Just my R.S.V.P.

BECCA: Just a maybe?

EVAN: So far. There's so much other fun shit that's gonna be happening that night that I can't really commit and, you know, hurt someone's feelings.

BECCA: Fun shit? But I never see you at parties or anything.

EVAN: That's because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing. I'd love to be at all of them, but...

BECCA: So why weren't you at Dimitri's on Saturday?

EVAN: There was just so many things going on. I couldn't find a minute to make an appearance-

BECCA: What did you do?

EVAN: -over there. Saturday was a crazy night for me.

As Evan describes the night, we cut through shots of him, Seth, and Fogell hanging out.

EVAN: I had some friends over, we had a few drinks. I hung out in my basement, the chill zone, where we chill-lax. Like "relax" and "chill" all at once. And, Seth's parents were throwing this party. We got to hang around adults, which was a nice change of pace. You know, you converse, you talk to people and they have interesting stories. I talked to a man who claimed he had climbed five mountains in his life.

BECCA: Wow.

EVAN: And then we went to a nightclub, which was incredible. This big, fancy one.

SETH: Gonna look at tits right now!

EVAN: �I'm feeling crazy.� I said that.

BECCA: You got in?

EVAN: We got right in.

EVAN: Wanna do this, 'roid monkey?

FOGELL: Fuck you!

EVAN: Then we called it a night. We were all just really exhausted.

SETH: What the fuck?

EVAN: You would've loved it. It was an incredible, unbelievable night.

BECCA: That sounds like a lot of fun. You know, I, I'd love to go do something like that sometime.

EVAN: Oh, who wouldn't? I mean, it was like, me and Seth are always kind of cooking up these fun, sort of, little, you know, events.

BECCA: So I guess you guys are really gonna go crazy next year together.

EVAN: Um, we were going to, but we got into different schools.

BECCA: Really? That sucks.

EVAN: Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad. I mean, it should be okay. Not too worried about it, really. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried at all.

BECCA: All right, well, thank you for the pen.

EVAN: Yeah. No problem. Bye.

The both walk away.

BECCA: Bye. Bye, Evan.

CUT TO: HOME EC CLASSROOM - DAY

Two students enter the classroom. Cut to Seth talking to Mrs. Hayworth.

SETH: Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this class because I'd be cooking with a partner. But she's never here, and I don't get twice the grades for doing all the work.

MRS. HAYWORTH: I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

SETH: I know, but look at Evan, okay? Just look at him.

They look over at Evan and his partner.

EVAN: Don't keep me waiting much longer. I'm getting impatient up here. You know what I'm talking about. Miroki, you're embarrassing me.

SETH: I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food and I gotta look over at that. Looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my life. And it's B.S. Excuse my language. I'm just saying that I wash and dry. I'm like a single mother. Look, we all know Home Ec is a joke, no offense. It�s just like, everyone takes this class to get an A. It's bullshit, and I'm sorry. I'm not putting down your profession, but it's just the way I feel. I don't wanna sit here all by myself cooking this shitty food. No offense. And I just think that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu. When am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There's three weeks left in school. Give me a fucking break. I'm sorry for cursing.

MRS. HAYWORTH: All right, Jules' partner isn't here today either. Pair up with her. Station four.

She walks away.

SETH: Jules? All right. I'll give it another shot. I'll give Home Ec another shot.

He looks over at Jules. Cut to a montage of Jules and Seth working together. Seth looks over at Evan and Miroki. They both engage in antics to make each other laugh.

SETH: Yeah, Hayworth won�t notice this if we cover it with chocolate.

JULES: The whole thing?

SETH: Just dump it on. I'm serious.

JULES: Okay.

SETH: And now it looks professional.

JULES: That's really impressive. It's beautifully done.

SETH: I think we're gonna get an A.

JULES: So, what are you doing tonight?

SETH: Probably nothing, why?

JULES: I don't know. My parents are out of town so I was thinking about having, like, a party. You know, I don't really know how many people are gonna be there but you could stop by if you wanted to.

SETH: Yeah, I love parties.

JULES: Really? I just don't really ever see you at them.

SETH: You know, it's a love-hate thing. So, like, you know, right now, I really love them, though. Yeah.

EVAN: Good shit, right, Miroki? Yeah.

Seth runs over to Evan.

SETH: Hey, Miroki, could we have a minute alone? Just- thanks.

Miroki walks away.

SETH: Dude, Jules is having a fucking party.

Fogell enters the classroom.

FOGELL: Hey!

SETH: Don't tell Fogell about the party.

FOGELL: Gangsters. what's up, guys? I was just walking down the hall and Nicola was right in front of me. She's wearing these tight white pants with this black G-string and you could see right through the pants, man. It was so sweet.

Cut to a flashback of Fogell following Nicola. She turns around to him. He looks at his watch.

FOGELL: Uh, It's 10:33.

NICOLA: What?

He turns and walks away. Cut back to the classroom.

FOGELL: I told her what time it was.

SETH: That's the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my entire life! That�s insane. Can I hear it again? You have time?

FOGELL: Yeah, yes, Seth. I'm really gonna miss your knee-slappers when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.

SETH: Yeah, well, while you guys are at Dartmouth, I'll be at State, where the girls are half as smart and twice as likely to fellash me.

FOGELL: What are you guys doing tonight? Asshole.

EVAN: We got nothing. Nothing tonight, Fogell.

FOGELL: No? well, if nothing comes up, we can get shitfaced again, yeah? I mean, you're always calling me a pussy and whatnot, but today you're wrong. At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand-new fake ID. Chica, chica yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.

SETH: That's insane. 'Cause Evan was like, "I heard about this party. we shouldn't tell Fogell about it." And I was like, "No, we should totally tell Fogell." And that way you could buy us booze now. It's awesome.

FOGELL: Yeah, sure, I'll buy the booze, man. Yeah, we're gonna get our drinks on. We're gonna party and get crunk and rock out, dude.

MRS. HAYWORTH: If you're not in this class, leave this class. Fogell! Hi.

FOGELL: Okay. I�m gonna go.

He leaves.

EVAN: Well done, man. Seriously. See you after class.

SETH: You tell that idiot you're not rooming with him next year?

EVAN: Not yet.

SETH: All right, well, you better. That guy's the fucking anti-poon.

Jules walks over.

JULES: Seth, it's dishes time, what's the holdup?

SETH: We're getting a fake ID, so� it's not like a big deal.

JULES: Wow.

SETH: Not a big thing.

CUT TO: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Evan and Seth sit across from each other eating lunch.

EVAN: Well, at least we're getting a graduation party. Thank God, man.

SETH: Oh, I'm excited. I would do terrible, disgusting things to hook up with Jules. Unforgivable things.

EVAN: I hear you, man. I'd give my middle nut to start dating Becca.

SETH: Becca's a bitch.

EVAN: You know what? I'm seriously getting fucking sick of you talking about her like that, frankly, if we can be honest with each other.

SETH: Me too.

EVAN: Like, why do you hate her so much? You've never given me a reason. I�m starting to just think that you like her.

SETH: Fuck no, man! I hate Becca.

EVAN: Why, man?

SETH: Fine, Evan. Here it comes. When I was a little kid, I kind of had this problem. And it's not even that big of a deal. Something like 8 percent of kids do it, but whatever. It's... For some reason, I don't know why, I would just kind of sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks.

EVAN: What?

SETH: Draw pictures of dicks.

EVAN: Dicks? Like a man dick?

SETH: Yeah. Like a man dick.

As Seth narrates, we cut to a flashback of a young Seth drawing dicks.

SETH: I'd just sit there for hours on end, drawing dicks. I don't know what it was. I couldn't touch the pen to paper without drawing the shape of a penis.

EVAN: That's fucked.

SETH: No shit, it's really fucked up. Here I am, this little kid and I can't stop drawing dicks
to save my own life.

EVAN: All right. I mean, I just don't see what this has to do with Becca.

SETH: Just listen. Okay? Your precious little Becca sat next to me for all of fourth grade. And in the classroom is where I did the majority of my illustrations. I was very secretive about this whole dick operation I had going on. Even I thought I was fucking crazy. Imagine what everyone else would think. So I would stash all of my dick drawings in this Ghostbusters lunchbox that I had. So one day I'm finishing up this real big, veiny, triumphant bastard. All of a sudden�

A kid knocks Seth�s notebook off of his desk and next to Becca.

KID: Pussy!

EVAN: You hit Becca's foot with your dick?

SETH: Yeah. I know.

YOUNG BECCA: Oh, my God!

SETH: She starts crying. She flips out. And she rats me out to the principal. He finds this Ghostbusters lunchbox dick treasure chest and he fucking flips out. He calls in my parents. Turns out this principal is some religious fanatic and he thinks I'm possessed by some dick devil. My parents make me see some therapist, and he's asking me dick questions. They literally made me stop eating foods that were shaped like dicks. No hot dogs, no popsicles. You know how many foods are shaped like dicks? The best kinds.

The flashbacks end.

EVAN: Yeah. Well, I don't� That's really messed up. Super gay.

SETH: All right, let's stop this madness. Let's just go get some dessert.

EVAN: No, I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor. I'm picking out my classes for next year.

Evan stands up.

SETH: What, so I gotta sit and eat dessert alone, like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?

EVAN: I gue- Yeah, I mean, what do you want me to do?

SETH: I don't know. Nothing. It's fine.

EVAN: Relax, man. I'll see you later.

SETH: That's fine. I'll be fine.

Evan leaves. A passing teen pushes Seth�s stuff off of the table.

TEEN: Hey, pussy.

SETH: Fuck off.

CUT TO: EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

Jules, Nicola, and another girl stand talking. Seth walks nearby.

JULES: Just the one. Just the one. Not both.

NICOLA: So I'll call Andy and Greg.

JULES: Okay.

NICOLA: And I'll bring the '80s dance music.

Nicola leaves. Jules spots Seth.

JULES: Seth! Hi. There you are. We were just talking about you.

SETH: Here I am.

JULES: That's weird. So you're coming to my party tonight? 'Cause it's, like, fully on.

SETH: Yeah, why? Should I not come? Because I could think of other shit-

JULES: Oh, no. No. I want you to come, I just, um� You said something earlier about, like, a fake ID or something, right?

SETH: Yeah, I'm gonna get one. For sure, for sure. I'm getting that for sure.

FRIEND: Can you get us booze?

SETH: Yeah. I can. I can get you guys alcohol.

JULES: Really? Seriously?

SETH: Yes, for sure.

JULES: Oh, that would be awesome. Thank you. Because, you know, we�re worried about that. That would be great. Plus, you know, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.

SETH: Well, Jules, the funny thing about my back is that it's located on my cock.

Seth and Jules laugh.

SETH: So you do want alcohol? You want some sort of alcohol or no? You do or you don't? You do want alcohol.

JULES: Um, yeah.

SETH: Either way.

JULES: Well-

SETH: Either way. Either way's fine.

JULES: This is actually kind of a big favor. Because my parents left me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week. But the house is full of food, so I just thought I'd spend it all on, you know, extra drinks for the party, so...

SETH: Yeah, that's really nice. I don't think I've ever done anything that nice.

JULES: It's cool?

SETH: Yeah.

JULES: Okay. Thank you.

FRIEND: Awesome.

JULES: I mean, seriously, that's really�

FRIEND: Thanks.

JULES: That's nice of you. Thank you.

SETH: So should I just get a shitload of different shit?

FRIEND: Well, you gotta get me some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.

SETH: Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of gay, but I can get it for you.

JULES: So, um, okay, so then we will see you tonight.

CUT TO: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Evan is on the soccer field during gym class.

TEACHER: Go to the ball, guys. Evan. Get into the game.

EVAN: Kick it over to me.

Seth runs onto the field.

TEACHER: Seth! Get off the field!

EVAN: Dude, get out of here. They're gonna make me run laps again.

SETH: Just fucking listen, okay? Jules and her stupid fucking friend came up to me and they asked me to buy her alcohol. But not just her, for her whole party. You know what that means? By some divine miracle, we were paired up and she actually thought of me. Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy she would trust with the whole fun-ness of her party. She wants to fuck me. She wants my dick in or around her mouth.

EVAN: Did you think that maybe she's using you to get her alcohol? She doesn't want your dick.

SETH: No, she's got an older brother. And she could have asked him, but she asked me. She looked me in the eyes and said, "Seth, mama�s making a pubic salad, and I need some Seth's Own dressing." She's D.T.F. She's down to fuck, man. P in vagi. She wants to fuck, man. Tonight is the night that fucking is an actual possibility.

EVAN: You just sound like an idiot. You're not gonna be able to sleep with her, man.

SETH: No. Dude, I know I talk a lot of shit, okay? But she's gonna be at the party, and she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, enough to get with me. At the very least, I'll make out with her. Two weeks, handjob. Month, blowjob. whatever, whatever. And then I make her my girlfriend. And I've got, like, two solid months of sex. By the time college rolls around, l'll be like the Iron Chef of pounding vag.

EVAN: Okay, can you just get out of here and we�ll talk about this later?

GREG: What the fuck, Evan? We're down two points.

EVAN: Fucking calm down, Greg. It's soccer. It's soccer.

GREG: Fuck you, man.

SETH: Hey, Greg, why don't you go piss your pants again?

GREG: That was, like, eight years ago, asshole.

SETH: People don't forget. Do you wanna hear the best part? Becca. You do the same thing with her. When you guys are shitfaced at the party, you get with her. This is our last party as high school people. I've fully ignored my hatred for Becca in coming up with this plan.

EVAN: I should buy Becca alcohol?

SETH: Yeah, it'll be pimp. That way you know she'll be drunk. You know when girls saying, like, "I was so shitfaced last night. I shouldn't have fucked that guy." We could be that mistake!

EVAN: Have you talked to Fogell?

SETH: All right, you talk to Becca. I'll talk to that retard, Fogell. Don't worry.

Seth runs off the field.

TEACHER: Seth, get off the field!

Seth kicks a ball.

SETH: Goal!

TEACHER: You're getting that!

SETH: No, I'm not!

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Evan approaches Becca in the hallway.

EVAN: Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.

BECCA: Oh, hey.

EVAN: Hey. Hi. Did you hear about the party tonight?

BECCA: Yeah. Yeah, I just heard. It sounds awesome.

EVAN: Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.

BECCA: Really?

EVAN: Yeah, I'm gonna go to it. That's actually why I came looking for you. Me and the guys are gonna go to a liquor store after class. And I just thought, you know, if you needed someone to get you yours, I could do that. I could be that person.

BECCA: Yeah. Um, yeah, no, that would be great. That would save me such a hassle, because I was gonna beg my sister, but... Could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?

EVAN: Yeah. That's the one with the little golden flakes in it?

BECCA: Yeah. The girly one.

EVAN: That's classy.

BECCA: Well, I'll pay you back at the party.

EVAN: No, no, no, you won't. No, it's my treat, miss.

BECCA: Really?

EVAN: Yep. And that's that. It's the first of many too, so get used to it, sister.

BECCA: Oh, well, thank you.

EVAN: Yeah, no problem.

Evan raises his hand. Someone behind him bumps into him, causing Evan to hit Becca�s boob.

EVAN: I'm sorry. That guy walked by. It was an accident.

BECCA: It's okay.

EVAN: I was gonna give you like a nudge, a punch, the friend thing.

BECCA: It�s okay.

EVAN: I didn't mean, I�m sorry-

Gaby approaches.

GABY: Hey, Becca.

BECCA: Oh, hey.

GABY: Hey.

BECCA: Gaby.

GABY: What's up, Evan?

EVAN: Hey, Gaby.

GABY: We should get to class.

BECCA: We're gonna go to class, so I will see you tonight.

EVAN: Okay.

BECCA: Really, don't worry.

EVAN: Okay. Sorry.

Becca and Gaby walk away.

BECCA: Bye.

EVAN: Sorry. Bye. Sorry.

CUT TO: EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

Seth stands at the bottom of some stairs. Evan approaches him.

SETH: Where is that sack of shit, Fogell? He said he'd be here after lunch. I'm sitting here with my thumb up my ass.

EVAN: I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it. It was pimp. I�m like, I feel like a pimp right now. Like one of those pimps.

SETH: That is fucking pimp.

EVAN: That's what I was afraid of.

SETH: Why didn't I think of that? Shit. Sh- we're screwed. Okay? We're screwed.

Cut to Evan and Seth in the school�s workshop.

SETH: This is what we get for trusting Fogell, okay? He pussied out. I know it Evan. He fucking pussied out.

Cut to Seth and Evan walking together outside.

SETH: How'd he get into Dartmouth? I don't get it. He's got shit for brains. All right, how else can we get alcohol?

Fogell approaches them.

FOGELL: Yo, guys! what's up?

EVAN: Fogell, where have you been, man?

SETH: You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack. Let me see it. Did you pussy out, or what?

FOGELL: No, no, man. I got it. It's flawless. Check it.

He hands them his fake ID.

EVAN: Hawaii?

FOGELL: Uh huh.

EVAN: All right, that's good. It's hard to trace, I guess. Wait, you changed your name to McLovin?

FOGELL: Yeah.

EVAN: McLovin? What kind of a stupid name is that, Fogell? You trying to be an Irish R&B singer?

FOGELL: No, they let you pick any name you want when you get down there.

SETH: And you landed on McLovin?

FOGELL: Yeah, it was between that or Mohammad.

SETH: Why the fuck would it be between that or Mohammad? Why not just pick a common name like a normal person?

FOGELL: Mohammad is the most commonly used name on Earth. Read a fucking book for once.

EVAN: Fogell, have you ever actually met anyone named Mohammad?

FOGELL: Have you actually ever met anyone named McLovin?

SETH: No, that's why you picked a dumb fucking name.

FOGELL: Fuck you.

SETH: Give me that. All right. You look like a future pedophile in this picture, number one. Number two, it doesn't even have a first name. It just says McLovin!

EVAN: What? One name? One name? who are you, Seal?

SETH: Fogell, this ID says you're 25 years old. Why wouldn't you just put 21, man?

FOGELL: Seth, Seth, Seth. Listen up, ass-face. Every day, hundreds of kids go into the liquor store with their fake IDs and every single one says they're 21. How many 21-year-olds you think there are in this town? It's called fucking strategy, all right?

EVAN: Let's stay calm, okay? Let's not lose our heads. It's a fine ID. It'll- It's gonna work. It's passable, okay? This isn't terrible. I mean, it's up to you, Fogell. This guy's either gonna think, "Here's a kid with a fake ID,� or, "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old Hawaiian organ donor." Okay? So, what's it gonna be?

FOGELL: I am McLovin.

SETH: No, you're not. No one's McLovin. McLovin's never existed because that's a made-up, dumb, fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!

They begin walking away.

FOGELL: Jeez, man. It'll work. Give it a chance.

SETH: Did you move my... where is my car?

EVAN: Oh, my God, man. Didn�t I tell you? What did I say to you? I told you not to park here.

FOGELL: Why would you park in the staff parking lot?

SETH: Shut the fuck up, Fogell.

FOGELL: I mean, because you're not staff.

SETH: I know that, Fagell! I know that! Evan, let's go to your house.

They leave.

FOGELL: Wait, are you guys still picking me up from work? Can you answer me?

CUT TO: INT. EVAN�S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Cut to an establishing shot of Evan�s house. Cut to inside. Evan plays video games while Seth tries on clothes.

SETH: Man, don't you have any non-infant clothes? It'll be fine.

EVAN: Yeah, and why don't you just wear what you wore to school?

SETH: No, I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in what I wore to school. It's completely unbecoming. No one's gotten a handjob in cargo shorts since Nam.

EVAN: You know why I have to kill these guys? 'Cause you don't negotiate with terrorists.

SETH: Oh, really?

EVAN: Terrorism.

SETH: Yeah, that's what we should be talking about right now.

EVAN: Then why don't you go to your house and get some of your own clothes?

SETH: No. That's the dumbest thing ever. If I go home, my parents will see that my car's been towed and I'll be grounded.

EVAN: God, these fucking terrorists multiply like bunnies. Where did I leave the M16?

SETH: Do you have any bigger clothes or do you only shop at babyGap?

EVAN: Fuck me. I can't� That's fun. Why do they make that? If you can't even win, then why am I fucking playing? Do you wanna go see what my dad has?

CUT TO: EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

�Bustin� Out (On Funk)� by Rick James plays. Cut to Seth and Evan getting off the bus. The approach Fogell as he gets out of work.

SETH: What the hell is that?

FOGELL: It's a fucking vest, dumbass. I'm trying to look older.

SETH: You look like Pinocchio.

EVAN: No, it's just a vest.

SETH: You know, they got a lot of booze in there. If we get it now, we can get to the party faster with all Jules's shit.

FOGELL: No way, man. I work there. They know I'm not 25.

SETH: Nobody said anything about you, dick-mouth. You really fucked me on this one. So now I'm gonna steal the booze.

FOGELL: Don't, don't do this. I promise you I'll get the liquor later. Mike Snider's ID always works. So will mine, man.

SETH: Mike Snider's ID doesn't have one fucking name on it! Okay? I thought you Dartmouth guys would be smart enough to understand that. Now Seth's gotta pick up all the pieces.

Seth walks towards the store.

EVAN: He won't do it. Don't worry.

FOGELL: Oh, I forgot to tell you, my mom said we can have the TV from the basement-

EVAN: Shut the fuck up, man, he's gonna hear you. Just be quiet. Wait until he goes away.

FOGELL: You still haven't told him that we're rooming together?

EVAN: Fogell, shut the fuck up. And take off your vest. You look like Aladdin.

FOGELL: Okay. You got it.

Cut to inside the store. Seth eyes the security guard. He passes an old lady in the liquor aisle. He imagines checking out with the clerk.

SETH: Hope piggy can run.

CLERK: How old are you?

SETH: Twenty-two.

CLERK: You certainly are. That'll be 80 dollars.

SETH: Oh, okay. Thank you kindly. will that do?

He gives the clerk an $80 bill.

CLERK: Certainly will. Thank you, Seth.

SETH: Hey, thank you.

He then imagines the woman in front of him dropping her purse. He picks it up for her.

SETH: Oh, you dropped your purse, ma'am. Would you like some help with your groceries?

WOMAN: Well, that would be lovely, young man. Would you like me to buy you alcohol?

SETH: That would be lovely.

He holds bags of liquor while she leaves.

SETH: Enjoy your remaining years.

WOMAN: I will. Enjoy fucking Jules.

SETH: I will.

He then imagines stealing some liquor.

COP: Don't do it, kid.

SETH: I never had a choice.

He imagines getting in a fight with the cop, during which the old woman is killed.

SETH: You fucking killed her! No!

The cop kills Seth. Cut back outside as Seth approaches Evan and Fogell.

FOGELL: Where's all the stolen liquor, Danny Ocean? Did you hide it up your butt?

SETH: Piss off! I was gonna do it, but there was a security breach. You never would've done it. Let's go to a liquor store and watch your stupid ID get rejected.

FOGELL: Wait, I'm gonna go put my vest back in my locker.

CUT TO: INT. BUS - EVENING

The trio sits on the bus. Cut to them exiting and approaching a liquor store.

EVAN: All right. Here we are. This is it. You ready?

FOGELL: Yeah.

EVAN: Yeah?

SETH: Here's the money and the list.

EVAN: Change is yours. Keep the change.

FOGELL: Thank you. what's the list for?

EVAN: The alcohol.

SETH: We're gonna get alcohol for the whole party, okay? We put a lot of time into this list, so don't fuck it up and get sambuca again.

EVAN: It's perfect.

FOGELL: Ouzo, bourbon, spiced rum, Goldslick...

EVAN: Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca. Don't forget that, okay?

FOGELL: Raspberry vodka, Scotch...

SETH: Oh, and Kyle's Killer Lemonade. A six-pack.

FOGELL: This is, this is a lot of stuff, man. I don't know if I can get away with all this.

EVAN: What difference does it make, how much it is?

FOGELL: I don't know, man. I'm, like, really nervous.

EVAN: Are you okay?

FOGELL: No, man. I should have wore the vest. Oh, no.

EVAN: Calm down.

SETH: What the fuck are you doing?

FOGELL: What if I go in there and they turn me down, man?

SETH: Then we're in the same exact place that we're in right now.

EVAN: Who cares?

FOGELL: It's fucking humiliating! Everybody in the store sees them kicking me out. What if they make me put the liquor back on the shelf? I can't do that.

EVAN: Oh, my God.

SETH: This whole thing is bigger than you, Fogell! So grow a pair of nuts and fucking walk in there and buy the alcohol!

FOGELL: What if I don't feel like it anymore, Seth? What?

SETH: Then I'll fucking kill you, okay? I�ll get a knife and stab you through your fucking heart.

EVAN: No, you can do this, man. Come on.

FOGELL: Killing me won't get you alcohol, jerk off. I'm the one with the fake ID.

SETH: Well, then I'll cut your dumb little fucking face off throw it over mine and get your ID and buy it my fucking self!

FOGELL: Oh, really? You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that, so ha! Peace.

Seth pushes him.

EVAN: Fogell, just be cool, man. Get in and get out. You're the hero.

Cut to Fogell entering the store. He nervously shuffles around. He accidentally drops a six pack of beer on the floor. An employee approaches.

EMPLOYEE: Is there a problem here, sir?

FOGELL: No. No problem whatsoever.

EMPLOYEE: Sir, did you do this? On the floor?

FOGELL: No. And you should really clean this up. Someone could really hurt themselves.

Fogell walks away.

EMPLOYEE: Fuck my life.

Cut back outside to Evan and Seth.

SETH: We're so fucked. We're so fucked. This plan's been fucked since Jump Street.

EVAN: Okay, just calm down. Just calm down, all right? Hey, so did you bring a condom for tonight?

SETH: You brought a condom with you?

EVAN: Yeah. I figured I might as well, you know? I brought a little bottle of spermicidal lube too.

SETH: But you laughed in my face when I said I'd be having sex tonight.

EVAN: Yeah, that doesn't mean you shouldn't just always be prepared. You didn't even bring a condom?

SETH: No. No, Evan, that wasn't part of the plan. I can�t believe you did this without consulting with me about it.

EVAN: Why are you talking about a plan? We've never discussed, like, any plan, but you keep saying we have a plan.

SETH: I had, like, a general outline. You know? I was gonna go down on her for, like, several hours, okay? She would love that. She'd be smitten by that. She'd go out with that. Or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.

EVAN: Okay, well, I just, I don't see the harm in bringing one little condom.

SETH: And one little bottle of spermicidal lube?

EVAN: Yeah, one little bottle of spermicidal lube.

SETH: Evan, that's psycho shit, man.

EVAN: No, it's not.

SETH: That's, like, Charles Manson shit. What, do you think Becca's gonna be psyched that you brought a bottle of lube? "Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing that lube for my pussy. I never would've been able to handle your fucking 4-inch dick inside my pussy without that gigantic bottle of lube."

EVAN: Okay, that's-

SETH: Fuck.

EVAN: That's enough.

SETH: These girls are 18 years old, they're not dried-up old ladies. They're good to go.

EVAN: Then I won't bring the lube.

Cut back into the store. Fogell puts the alcohol on the counter.

FOGELL: Hello, Mindy.

She scans some of the items.

FOGELL: I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years. You know, I heard they recently decided to add more hops to it.

MINDY: Um, okay. I'm gonna need to see some identification.

FOGELL: Really? Makes me feel young again.

He shows her the ID. Cut back to Seth and Evan.

SETH: Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins. She had the biggest tits I've ever seen.

EVAN: Yeah, I heard she got breast-reduction surgery.

SETH: What? Making your tits smaller? That's like slapping God across the face for giving you a gorgeous gift.

EVAN: She had back problems, man. And it's not just making them smaller. They completely reshape them. They make them more supple and symmetrical.

SETH: I gotta catch a glimpse of these warlocks. Let's make a move.

They run to Cary.

EVAN: She's going around the corner.

SETH: Come on!

Cut back into the store.

MINDY: Okay. Your total is 96.59.

A man enters the store and punches Fogell across the face. He takes some money out of the register and runs.

MINDY: I don't believe it! Are you okay, mister?

FOGELL: What the shit was that?

MINDY: I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

Cut back to Evan and Seth returning to the parking lot.

SETH: I don't know, man. I think she looked better before.

EVAN: But now that she can jog comfortably, she's in the best shape she's ever� What is this? What's that?

They see a cop car outside the liquor store.

SETH: Oh, man.

They look inside the store window and see the cops talking to Fogell and Mindy.

EVAN: Holy shit, they busted Fogell.

SETH: How did this happen, Evan? Fuck, man!

EVAN: His dad's gonna fucking kill him.

Cut back into the store.

MINDY: Look, okay? He assaulted the customer, grabbed the cash and ran out.

SLATER: So...

MICHAELS: How...

SLATER: How, how...

MICHAELS: Say when, height-wise.

SLATER: I'm gonna start up here, just tell me when.

MICHAELS: I'll start on the bottom and...

MINDY: When. Whatever 5'10" is, he was 5'10".

SLATER: Ethnically, I mean, did, what, um� I mean, was he� Was he like us, or...

MINDY: A woman?

SLATER: No.

MINDY: Female?

MICHAELS: No.

MINDY: Is that what you're asking?

SLATER: No, no.

MICHAELS: Was he�

SLATER: Like...

MINDY: What? What?

MICHAELS: African?

SLATER: Af- African?

MINDY: Was he African?

MICHAELS: African.

MINDY: No. He was American, and he was like you. He looked just like you.

MICHAEL: He was Jewish. Okay, Jew. It's an odd crime for a Jew to commit.

SLATER: They're pretty docile.

MICHAELS: Okay, so we have an African Jew wearing a hoodie.

MINDY: Look, I can't do this. I told you already, I have an exam tomorrow. Can you understand that? I have a goddamn veterinary exam! Goddamnit. This is bullshit. This is some bullshit. I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.

Mindy leaves.

SLATER: Well, apparently someone has an exam.

MICHAELS: How'd you know?

SLATER: You. You're the one that got punched?

FOGELL: Yeah.

MICHAELS: Okay. First things first. What is your name?

FOGELL: Uh. My name? It's M... McLov... McLovin.

MICHAELS: McLovin?

FOGELL: Yeah.

SLATER: Now, what's your first name?

FOGELL: What?

SLATER: Your first name.

FOGELL: My first name? Technically I don't have a first name, so don't worry about my first name.

MICHAELS: But we're the police.

SLATER: We just wanna get the story straight.

Cut back to Seth and Evan, who leave.

SETH: Come on.

EVAN: Fuck, man.

SETH: Come on!

EVAN: He must be so afraid.

SETH: I don't believe this bullshit. I can't believe this is happening! I didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit. We need that liquor.

EVAN: Are they gonna, like, take him downtown, or something?

SETH: Fuck Fogell. He got arrested, okay? We're on our own. We need a new way to get liq� Ah, fuck! The money, man! Fuck! How much money can you get?

EVAN: Why are you talking about money, man? What about Fogell?

SETH: That doesn't matter anymore. I lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money. What are we gonna do, bust him out of jail? I�m gonna bake him a cake with a fucking file in it? Fuck Fogell. we need a new way to get liquor, which is fucking impossible because we don�t have any money. Fuck!

EVAN: All right, you just need to calm down. We need to think for a second. We just need to think this out.

SETH: Fuck thinking, we need to act!

Seth gets hit by a car.

EVAN: Woah, Seth!

SETH: What the fuck happened?

EVAN: Just, just get up. Slowly. You all right? You okay?

Francis gets out of the car. Evan helps Seth up.

FRANCIS: I am so sorry, man. I am so sorry. I didn't even effing see you at all, man. Are you okay?

Cut back into the store.

SLATER: So it's just McLovin?

FOGELL: Yeah.

MICHAELS: That's badass.

SLATER: That is badass.

MICHAELS: Really cool.

SLATER: That�s a badass name.

MICHAELS: Yeah.

SLATER: Lot of people with weird names nowadays.

MICHAELS: Chingy. Shakira. Rafe. Pax.

SLATER: We arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Fuck."

MICHAELS: Think he was Vietnamese, it was with a PH. But it's still pretty shocking to see on a license. Okay, and how old are you, McLovin?

FOGELL: Old enough.

SLATER: Old enough for what?

FOGELL: To party.

MICHAELS: Can I see your ID?

FOGELL: Yeah, I think I have it.

He hands them his ID. They look at it for a moment and whisper to each other.

SLATER: You're an organ donor.

FOGELL: What?

SLATER: I didn't wanna be one, but my wife insisted.

MICHAELS: I always give him shit for it too. All the time. I say, "It's just like a woman. Even after you're dead they wanna tear your heart out."

SLATER: They wanna tear your�

MICHAELS: I say it weekly and it's still funny.

SLATER: It still makes me laugh.

MICHAELS: Really funny.

SLATER: There you go.

FOGELL: I'm sorry, guys. I don't really have any information. He just kind of hit me, and I didn't really see what he looked like. I don't know if I can help you.

MICHAELS: You in a hurry, or something?

FOGELL: Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.

SLATER: Where were you headed?

FOGELL: Uh, near 13th and Granville.

SLATER: We can take you there. Get your information on the way.

FOGELL: No, you don�t have to.

MICHAELS: Why waste 2 bucks?

SLATER: We'll take you. No problem.

Cut back to Seth and Evan talking to Francis.

FRANCIS: Please, please don't report me, man. We can figure this out, right? We can figure this out, right?

SETH: Why the fuck wouldn't I report you? You just hit me with your car.

FRANCIS: I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I have a warrant out for a totally nonviolent crime. Okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.

SETH: Well, I'll be honest with you for a second.

FRANCIS: Okay.

SETH: You better get us a shitload of cash, or a shitload of alcohol, or you're going to fucking prison.

EVAN: What are you doing, man? That�s�

FRANCIS: Okay.

Francis takes out his wallet.

EVAN: You don't need to- No, let's not, let's hang on a second here.

SETH: Cough it up.

FRANCIS: Fine.

EVAN: I don't know if we should be doing anything official.

FRANCIS: Just take it, just take it, okay?

Francis hands Seth some money.

SETH: Seven dollars? What the fuck, man. This isn't
enough. What are you, six years old?

FRANCIS: It's all I have, man. It's all I have.

SETH: Well, you better think of something quickly, all right? Ah, my back! My back! Cops, my back.

FRANCIS: No, no, no. wait, don't do that. All right, listen. You want booze? I can get you alcohol. Bro, I'm on my way to a party right now, okay? There�s like, tons of liquor there, all right? And I can, I can definitely get you, like, tons of liquor. Like, so much liquor, so.

EVAN: Just give me one sec to talk to him.

SETH: Stay right here.

FRANCIS: Just talk it out. Hey, I'm a nice guy.

EVAN: I don't like this idea at all. This guy's fucking creepy, man. Look at him.

SETH: What? He looks like a guy. That's what guys look like. What is your problem?

FRANCIS: You guys know a guy named Jimmy? You totally look like his brother. You totally look like his brother, man. You do.

SETH: You promised Becca you'd get her alcohol. If you don't, she's gonna have a shitty night. That's all I'm saying. Come on.

Cut to Slater, Michaels, and Fogell leaving the store.

MICHAELS: Good luck on your exam tomorrow.

SLATER: Good luck on your exam. You don't wanna ride the bus, anyway.

MICHAELS: Buses smell like piss, generally. You know why?

FOGELL: Why?

MICHAELS: People piss on them.

CUT TO: INT. CAR - EVENING

Francis sits in the driver�s seat while Seth and Evan sit in the back.

FRANCIS: You know, one of you bros could've come up and sat up with me.

SETH: We're fine back here.

EVAN: Back's fine.

SETH: Safe in the back seat.

Seth gets a call from Jules. Cut back and forth between Jules�s house and the car.

SETH: Oh. Oh, my God.

EVAN: What's up?

SETH: Hey, Jules.

FRANCIS: Who is it? Who's on the phone?

JULES: Seth. Hey, where are you?

SETH: I'm in a cab right now, on the way to a liquor store.

JULES: Oh, yeah. Good. I can't wait for you to get here.

SETH: Well, I hope your friends are ready to get fucked up.

Francis goes for a high five. Neither Seth nor Evan go for it.

JULES: I'm sure they will be. Okay, I'll see you soon.

SETH: Peace. Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy. She called, she said, "I can't wait for you to get there."

FRANCIS: That sounds like she fully wants it, man! Oh, yeah! Who's gonna give it to her, huh,
my man? You, that's who. Man. You guys on MySpace? Or�

CUT TO: INT. COP CAR - EVENING

�Why Do I Cry� by The Remains plays. Cut to the cop car.

FOGELL: Um, officers? I can answer those questions now if you want me to.

SLATER: We get the gist of it. You were buying beer, some guys punched you. Don't worry about it. We're not gonna find them.

MICHAELS: Case closed.

FOGELL: But it was only-

The light ahead of them turns red.

MICHAELS: Oh, whoop.

They turn on their police lights and go through the red light.

FOGELL: But it was only one guy.

SLATER: Only one guy? Shit. How am I supposed to find one guy in the whole county?

MICHAELS: This job really isn't how, you know, shows like CSI make it out to be. When I first joined the force, I assumed there was semen on everything, and there was some, like, huge semen database that had every bad guy's semen in it. There isn't. That doesn't exist. It'd be nice. Like that crime scene today. If the man had ejaculated and then punched you in the face, we'd have a real good shot at catching him.

SLATER: No way.

MICHAELS: Just punched in the face, no semen.

SLATER: No semen.

MICHAELS: Story of my life.

SLATER: Oh.

They turn on their lights to go through another red light.

SLATER: Michaels here, he's six months in. He's young, but the Force is strong with this one. Learning you are, young padawan.

MICHAELS: Thank you very much.

SLATER: That's Yoda.

MICHAELS: Are you familiar with Yoda?

SLATER: From Attack of the Clones?

WOMAN ON PA: We have a 245 at East 24 and Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.

SLATER: Car 98 on it. See, Michaels, you always take a call at a bar because, uh, better or worse, you get a beer out of it.

MICHAELS: Wow.

SLATER: Pretty sweet, huh?

MICHAELS: True that. Amazing thinking.

SLATER: Hey, McLovin. We got a situation at Bailey's, so we'll drop you off after, all right?

FOGELL: Actually, I kind of have to be somewhere-

SLATER: Sweet. Sit tight.

MICHAELS: Set course for Bailey's Bar and Grill, warp 10. Engage.

They turn their lights on.

CUT TO: EXT. MARK�S HOUSE - EVENING

Francis, Seth, and Evan arrive at Mark�s house.

FRANCIS: Yeah. Welcome to the Thunderdome.

EVAN: Hey, man, are you sure it's cool that we're here with you?

FRANCIS: Oh, definitely, man. I'm essentially best friends with the guy so a bunch of my buds are coming. We're gonna rock out with our cocks out. Just kidding. We are gonna rock out.

SETH: Just go, just go.

FRANCIS: What's up? What's up? What's up? Hello, hello. Hey, guys.

Cut inside the house.

EVAN: This is something a smart person wouldn't do.

SETH: Look, just act cool and act casual, and try and look old. We'll get the booze and get the fuck out of here, okay?

Francis gets on the phone. He gestures towards the booze.

SETH: We should just grab one of these buckets and get out of here.

EVAN: Are you out of your mind? How are we gonna get a fucking bucket out of here?

Mark approaches Francis.

FRANCIS: Hey, man.

MARK: What the fuck do you think you're doing?

FRANCIS: What are� What? Nothing.

MARK: You using my phone?

FRANCIS: What's wrong, Mark?

MARK: You weren't invited. Get the fuck out of here.

FRANCIS: Come on, Mark. It's cool, man.

MARK: You using my fucking phone? You calling your fucking friends again?

FRANCIS: Mark, come on. It�s fine.

MARK: You calling your friends, your fantastic friends? Get the fuck out of my house.

Mark hangs up the phone and throws Francis around.

FRANCIS: Mark!

MARK: Get the fuck out of my house. This is my house.

FRANCIS: Don't be such a dick, man!

SETH: What the fuck?

Cut to outside the house.

FRANCIS: Mark! You really wanna do this, man?

Mark pushes Francis over.

MARK: That's right, motherfucker.

MAN 1: Come on, pussy. Get up, dude.

Francis punches Mark.

FRANCIS: Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro. Tiger got out of the cage, man. All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark. Let's just chill. Everyone just chill out. Truce, man.

Mark kicks Francis.

MAN 2: Right in the nads!

MARK: This is for your friends. Here, have another one.

Cut inside the house. Seth and Evan run through.

EVAN: Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit. Oh, my God. What do we do?

SETH: Come on. Come on.

EVAN: Choose one. We can slip out the back, man.

SETH: Wait, wait, come on. We�re here, let's just hurry up and do this.

EVAN: Are you crazy, man? You wanna end up like that guy? Not me. I need my nuts, man, for a lot of things.

SETH: Well, we need this liquor.

EVAN: No, you need it. I don't need it. I'm just gonna tell Becca how I feel, and then maybe she'll get with me. Okay? I'm not gonna get her drunk out of her mind.

SETH: Oh, really? Then how come you never made a move, you pussy?

EVAN: Because I respect her, Seth. I'm not gonna put that kind of unfair pressure on her, all right?

SETH: I mean, come on, I just don't see a problem here. Let's just do it.

EVAN: We're leaving, okay? These guys could kill us, man. You wanna get killed for liquor?

SETH: No, but I would get killed for pussy, no questions asked.

EVAN: Fuck this, man.

SETH: You're just gonna bail on me?

EVAN: I'm going.

SETH: Fucking bitch.

SLATER: Oh, my God, that is bona fide badass, man. You gotta keep that tape, McLovin. It is badass. It really is.

FOGELL: Really? Well, don't you guys, like, need it for, like, evidence or...?

MICHAELS: The only thing that's evidence of is you can take a hit like a champ, man. Seriously. Take that.

FOGELL: Are there any ladies we'd like to show this tape to?

MICHAELS: No. You don't wanna meet a chick in a bar, man. Seriously. That was a major turning point in my life, was when I realized that. You gotta go to other places. You gotta
go to a spin class, a farmers' market, pumpkin patch, given the time of year. Just somewhere social, non-threatening. You know, something like that.

SLATER: Yeah, I met the missus at paintball. Yeah, I shot her in the neck, and we just, and we just hit it off, you know? My first wife, who is a whore, by the way, where do you think I met her? A bar. A bar.

MICHAELS: It was this bar.

SLATER: It was this bar. Yeah, it was this bar. Bought her a Binion's, complimented her on her tote bag, and next thing I know, she's putting her mouth around the tip of my penis.

FOGELL: You don't have to tell me that.

MICHAELS: Right in there.

SLATER: She opened up my world, sexually. On our wedding night, we had group sex. I wasn't involved in it. But I could hear it through the wall.

MICHAELS: I was.

SLATER: She was amazing. And then it was exactly 23 months later that I found out that she was an actual whore.

MICHAELS: We discovered her on the street.

MICHAELS: I get it.

SLATER: What is it? What is it?

MICHAELS: Like-

MICHAELS: Like coming.

SLATER: That's funny. That is really funny.

Slater imitates the sound of the PA.

SLATER: Whoo! All right, looks like we got a call. We can't pay for these.

MICHAELS: 10-4, we�ll be right there.

BECCA: Guys, shut up.

EVAN: Hey, what's going on over there?

EVAN: No, no, I'm gonna be there for sure. Full throttle. Charlie's Angels 2.

MAN 3: My brother came from Scottsdale, Arizona to be here tonight. And you're not gonna sing for him?

BENJI: Fucking bullshit.

MAN 1: Sing.

BENJI: You're a fucking singer.

MAN 3: You sing. And you sing good.

BENJI: Sing it again.

MAN 2: Like a bird.

EVAN: No, I know, I just, I want to-

EVAN: You're making me feel like I'm a bad guy. What am I... I didn't do anything wrong. I got into a good school.

SETH: How the fuck am I supposed to get into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't get into Dartmouth.

EVAN: How fucking selfish are you? You had no problem letting Fogell take the fall back there, you obviously don't want me going to a good school.

SETH: Fuck, man!

EVAN: So, what the fuck do you want? I'm not gonna let you slow me down anymore, Seth.

SETH: What are you saying?

EVAN: I've wasted the last three years of my life sitting around talking bullshit with you, man! Instead of chasing girls and making friends l've just sat around wasting all my time with you. And now because of you I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin.

SETH: Is this about Becca? This is about some girl, man?

EVAN: I like her!

SLATER: Hey, hey, Where's the love?

EVAN: He's okay. He's fine.

SLATER: Stand right next to your friend. Get over there.

SLATER: I don't believe you. Freeze. Stand right there.

EVAN: We're telling the truth.

SLATER: Yeah, keep it going. Don't be a hero tonight, guys.

Michaels gets in the car with Fogell. Slater stays outside and points his gun at Seth and Evan.

SLATER: Spread your shit! Get on the ground! Loaded gun, ready to go! Spread your shit! Pussies on the pavement, fellas. Come on!

EVAN: Please don't shoot, sir.

SLATER: "Please don't shoot." Shut up and spread your shit! I am the law! Okay? Now hold hands.

FOGELL: Yeah, you guys, you guys are awesome.

MICHAELS: Thanks. We really like you too, McLovin. So here's what's about to happen. We're gonna arrest these two guys, and you're gonna write a witness report saying they leapt in front of our car like madmen and there was nothing we could do to avoid hitting them. Sound cool?

FOGELL: Yeah, that's fine.

MICHAELS: Good.

Cut back outside the car.

Slater runs to the car.

MICHAELS: Stop!

Michaels continues to chase Evan. Slater kicks out the broken windshield. Michaels gets tired out chasing Evan.

MICHAELS: That was a fast kid.

Slater speeds away, having ejected the drunk bum from the car.

SLATER: McLovin!

SETH: Come on.

SETH: I thought you didn't need it anyways. You were gonna tell her how you feel.

EVAN: Okay, well, good luck getting Jules drunk enough to have sex with you.

FOGELL: What's Wrong With you guys?

SETH: Told me what?

EVAN: Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.

They stop walking.

FOGELL: Well, we gotta tell him now.

EVAN: Fogell...

SETH: What are you guys talking about? Tell me right now.

FOGELL: Seth, me and Evan are rooming together next year at college. What's the big deal? "Oh, my God, Fogell's rooming With Evan." Jeez, Why don't you go cry about it?

EVAN: I didn't tell you because I, I thought-

SETH: Because you're a backstabber, and you lied to your best friend, and you only want to hang out with Fogell, and you just don't care anymore? I didn't expect this from you, Evan. Not from you. Give me that booze, Fagell.

EVAN: Really? What was she saying? She told you that she thinks I'm a good guy?

GABY: No, no. She said something more like, "I will fully blow him tonight."

EVAN: What?

GABY: I know. Yeah.

EVAN: But she's totally hammered, and if I get with her and I'm not drunk, isn't that like unethical?

JULES: Your last chance to do what?

SETH: To make you my girlfriend for the summer. You're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me. I thought we'd both be drunk.

JULES: What does me being drunk have anything to do with it?

SETH: You'd never get with me if you were sober. Look at you. Look at me.

JULES: Seth, come on, you didn't blow it. I think maybe-

SETH: Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.

He picks Evan back up and makes his way out the house.

MICHAELS: Okay, everyone, prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law. Get out. Come on, go.

MICHAELS: Shut up. Calm down.

SLATER: Why?

MICHAELS: Calm down, man.

SLATER: What?

MICHAELS: You just cock-blocked McLovin. Okay? He's our friend. We don't do that. We should be guiding his cock, not blocking it. Just relax, okay? Let's make this right.

Fogell uses his inhaler. Slater and Michaels sit on either side of him.

FOGELL: Yeah.

MICHAELS: You know, in a way, I think we wanted to show ourselves.

SLATER: Also, I'm... I'm really sorry that I blocked your cock.

They hug it out. Nicola grabs her shoes and looks at them confused before leaving.

MICHAELS: Seriously, man. That feels good. Oh, it feels so good.

FOGELL: I missed you guys.

MICHAELS: I just wish we could make it up to you somehow, man.

FOGELL: Well, do you think you can do me a really big favor?

SLATER: What is it? Anything.

MICHAELS: Name it.

Cut outside the party. Slater and Michaels drag Fogell along in handcuffs while everyone from the party watches.

SLATER: This kid's fucking crazy.

MICHAELS: Stay back for your own safety.

FOGELL: Get off me, you fucking cops. Get your hands off. Do you know who I am? I'm Fogell. The joint can't hold me.

FOGELL: Oh, my God.

SLATER: What did I tell you guys, right?

FOGELL: That was crazy.

SLATER: Panama! Panama! All right. All right, now, guys, check this out. It's probably the greatest move in doughnut-spinning history. You paying attention? Behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.

MICHAELS: Why is it called that?

SLATER: I don't know.

He drives away. Michaels and Fogell watch him.

MICHAELS: Make the badge proud, Slater. He's not usually this drunk when he does this, but I think that could make it more cool.

SLATER: McLovin!

He begins the donut but loses control of the car.

MICHAELS: Oh, no.

SLATER: Fuck!

Slater crashes into a pole.

SLATER: Yes. Oh, my God. It worked! It worked. We won! We won.

FOGELL: Can we shoot at it?

SLATER: I don't know. Can you?

EVAN: You don't even know
.
SETH: I gotta tell you. I gotta tell you something, Evan.

EVAN: I'm sorry, man, I don't know. I should've told you. I don't know why I didn't.

EVAN: Yeah, you don't, I mean, you don't have to, you know. I don't really have anything going on. You don't have to rush off like that.

SETH: What do you think?

EVAN: I don't know, man. Don't ask me. Because I don't give a shit how pants look.

SETH: Yeah, I need someone's opinion.

EVAN: Those are too tight. Those are way too tight.

SETH: Yeah, but, like-

EVAN: Way too tight. You need to upgrade.

SETH: Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's pants last night, I realized that if I wear pants that are, like, a little too small, it might encourage me to lose weight. And also, chicks can kind of see, like, you know, the borders and outline of my dick a little.

EVAN: Yeah, man, they go nuts for that. The male camel toe.

SETH: Yeah, the camel tail. It's right-

EVAN: I know where it is, where it happens.

SETH: Like, right there. It's like they're so tight that one ball is, like, above my dick, even.

EVAN: Yeah, exactly.

SETH: It's like three. It's like a three thing. It's like ball, dick, ball.

EVAN: It's like a, it�s like a division sign.

SETH: Like a bunch of people crammed into a van.

EVAN: You know, I just wish your dick is off.

SETH: You're right, these look stupid. Let's get the fuck out of here.

Cut to Jules and Becca ascending an escalator in the mall.

BECCA: I'm really sorry about that. I can't believe I actually did that.

JULES: I feel bad that I'm making you buy me a new one. It's seems, like, ridiculous.

BECCA: No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross.

JULES: Oh, my God.

Seth and Evan walk in the mall. Both pairs spot each other.

SETH: Do alcoholics get hangovers?

EVAN: Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. It's them.

BECCA: Uh, you know, I actually don't remember much.

EVAN: I don't remember anything. So weird.

SETH: Nothing.

BECCA: Um, I didn't puke on you, did I?

EVAN: You didn't. I remember that you- I avoided it. It whizzed right by me, and I said, "Stay away from me," you know.

BECCA: I'm really sorry about everything last night, and I just� Thank you for being such a nice guy about it all.

EVAN: Oh, that's okay, you know. At least you don't have a black eye from it.

They all look at Jules and smile awkwardly.

SETH: That looks terrible.

JULES: Yeah.

SETH: You look great. You don't look terrible. It's just, like, a bad bruise. Everything's great, just from he- This, just like right there.

EVAN: Your eye.

SETH: Yeah, your eye. Everything else is great. But seriously, I acted like a fucking idiot last night. You don't deserve that. So, I'm sorry. On the upside, I think you look cool with a black eye. I'm just gonna throw that out there. I don't, I don't know.

JULES: Well, thank you, smart guy. Thanks. That's actually why I'm here. Because I have to get a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.

SETH: Oh, man. Fuck.

BECCA: And I'm gonna get Jules a new comforter.

EVAN: Oh, I have to get a comforter too. For college.

BECCA: Oh, yeah?

EVAN: Yeah, I just figured I would need one.

JULES: So, Seth... . So do you wanna come buy me cover-up or something? I mean, you kind of owe me.

SETH: Yeah, definitely. I would love to do that. I had such bad acne last year that I pretty much became, like, an expert on the stuff. Well, you drove. Evan drove me here, though, so...

JULES: Well, so, well, I mean, I have my dad's car. So I could just give you a lift, and then Evan could take Becca home.

EVAN: Okay.

JULES: If that works. I don't know if it's in your route.

BECCA: That would be fine with me.

EVAN: Fine, yeah. Maybe we can get some food.

BECCA: Yeah, I'd like that.

SETH: So I guess I'll call you, then.

EVAN: Yeah, give me a call. Yeah, you have my number.

SETH: I have your information. So put her there.

They shake hands.

EVAN: Perfect. Good. All right, man.

SETH: Okay.

EVAN: Okay, guys.

The two pairs split off, Jules and Seth going back down the escalator and Becca and Evan staying on the upper level.

SETH: Becca.

EVAN: Bye, guys.

JULES: Bye, you guys.

EVAN: Bye, have fun.

BECCA: See you, Jules.

EVAN: Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.

Seth and Evan look at each other as they depart. �P.S. I Love You� by Curtis Mayfield begins playing. Seth points at Jules and mouths to Evan, �I�m gonna fuck her.�

BECCA: Where do you wanna go to eat?

JULES: So can you honestly help me figure out what kind of cover-up to get?

As Seth and Jules reach the bottom floor, Evan and Becca disappear over the top of the escalator. Seth and Jules walk through the mall as the camera pans to a wide shot.

END CREDITS

SETH: I love you.
