[Verse 1: Monkey]
Still pulling up on smoke (Smoke)
Skeng in my pocket, can't you see the bulge in my coat? (Bulgy)
Like Hollow meets Blade, man-a-man got guns that'll sink down a boat (boat, boat)
Send a young boy round with a skeng
They ain't leaving till they see smoke (Bow-bow-bow-bow)
My niggas the realest in town, you niggas are really some jokes (Fucking jokes)
Feds locked bro watching EastEnders; it's a fucking joke
(Free bro, free bro)
Trapping ain't dead, the nitty still clucking and ringing my phone (ringing)
Chilling with bro, talking 'bout money, dough to the dome (Money)

[Verse 2: Dimzy]
Turn up on your block, ten toes, man will do it, no plan
Man will do it, no plan
In four-door trucks, I took risks, man, soon gon' bring out the chopper in the van (Skrr)
I was in the trap on Snapchat watching everybody turn up mad (mad)
Can't lie, that shit got me mad but I was hugging up all them bands
Just done road with Snoopy (trap), bare Uncle Fest and amm'
Got my face all droopy, Bro got guap like Gucci
See him in Stoney, not Gucci (Gucci)
The ops used to laugh at my truck but they cut when they see that hooptie (Skrr-skrr)
Whip that skeng out the coat, watch it sink like Susie (Bow)

[Hook: LD]
Still pulling up, no messing (Pull up)
67, my brothers
Spare no one for my bredrins
Bitches be loving the gang
You see it all over my mentions
Put things in the car, let's lurk (All of that)
We ain't looking for normal pedestrians
How you gonna do man dirty? (How?)
Got things on things and we lurky
Get bricks on bricks from the plug
'Cause you know that my team's certi' (Gang)
How you gonna do man dirty? (How)
Got things on things and we lurky (Lurky)
Get bricks on bricks from the plug
'Cause you know that my team's certi' (All of that, all of that, all of that)

[Verse 3: ASAP]
I've got mad hate for the undies
Moving like gyal, tryna cuff me (Dickhead)
.44 spin, that's rusty (mad)
And the corn is chunky (Mad)
More time, I be in the trap
With Chris Brown and Rita Ora
All the in and outs
To go hit the cells, it's hot like a sauna (Flame)
So I switch the trap
Flip the packs, I need all the mula (All of that, all of that)
Wagwan for the judge?
Done the mandem dirty (mad)
Free up my young G Pulloff (Free 'em)
Chopper on the ride, that's lengthy (Mad)
Fifty shot, the skeng's full up (Mad)
Niggas do the dash when man pull up (Dashing)

[Verse 4: LD]
Still outside drilling (Out 'ere)
Bro's came home from the jail, bought him a phone, then he made him a killing
Ops dem know where the hill is (Six), they ain't come around here (No)
Raise both arms up figure eight, that's two .44s in the air (Bow)
How you gonna do man dirty? (How?)
Bro whips that grub, man a whip that skeng
Got me feeling like Shirley (Whip)
Went from a twenty-five shot to a fifty shot
We don't know about 30s (Yeah, all of that, all of that)
Any time I phone my plug
Better know that call's nothing less than a birdie (All of that, all of that)
Put skengs in the car, then I phone my bro like, "Let's get lurky"

[Hook: LD]
Still pulling up, no messing (Pull up)
67, my brothers
Spare no one for my bredrins
Bitches be loving the gang

[Verse 5: Giggs]
Get low-down, tell a man straight
Man already know, 67 and H
Three, four, five, six, seven man rolled up
Three .45, 67, man ate
Man just rolled up, pepper then doughnut
Two .45s then severed man's plates
Man's just colder, everyone load up
'Cause in this jungle, everyone's apes
I want everyone's cake
Man play hero? Bury man's cape
And there's bare subliminal riders
So what's everyone saying? (man's sayin'?)
And man ain't even on these games
But I noticed everyone's playing
And I don't even need no soldiers
Man know Hollowman's spraying
I've never really been on that running shit
Niggas know Hollowman's staying (Woof)
And way before all of this money shit
Niggas knew Hollowman's name
They love it when I come on this gully shit
Niggas know Hollowman's lane
They know a nigga bring that next level shit
Nigga, call me Hollowman Saiyan

[Hook: LD]
Still pulling up, no messing (Pull up)

Block 6, d'you get it?
Free A
Free KP
Free all the mandem

[Verse 1: Young A6]
I can’t even talk on the drills we've done
'Cah the drills we’ve done might get me nicked (Uh-huh)
I ain’t tryna buck into P.C. Smith
Big ying on my hip and he knows what it is (Shoo)
Last time that I cut from the CID on the strip
Next day, took trips with the stick (Uh-huh)
S1 tripped and he nearly got hit
Now broski's pissed, get rid of that drip (Burn that)
Fuck it, we gotta get rid of them garms
Swingin' my Anglo Arms (Shoo)
Free A6, yeah, he's readin' the Psalms
I can never die in the ends likе ****
New flavour, fling it in pot
Paigons run from the gang, get droppеd
Pyrex, water, it's lookin' like Voss
And I trap, make prof
In this ting, I'm a boss (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Lucii]
JJ got poked by me (By me)
*** got poked by me (By me)
*** got poked by me
And the agro Albo did high-knees (High-knees)
I don't know about being a victim
I never lack, got my big ramz (Uh-huh)
But I refuse to grip on a kitchen
Ching him, I won't get caught on a slip ting (Splash)
Dip my shank up in humans
Itch it deep and do the job right (Hmm)
I ain't got time for a fight
Just back my blade for the cranberry Sprite (Gimme)
What you know about dippin' your shank in shit
Tryna wet and infect young man?
What you know about sittin' in back of the cab?
Got ten rambos in the bag (Uh-uh)

[Verse 3: Tzgwala]
When their block gets spun
One gunshot from the Glock, get done (Bu-du)
You don't wan' fi get bun
Get lighted up like the party's tun
How can you say it's not beef?
When that's your Gs, and my gang made you run
And Luc put two in your bredrin's back (That's two)
Are you fuckin' dumb?
Rico must be smokin' skud
He ain't ever draw blood (No, he ain't)
But I still had red in my eyes that day on your block with the six G1s
Caught one yute, gave him more than a beatin'
And left him bleedin', the TSG come
YP soaked up a pikey cunt
And the gang said, "Nicely done"

[Verse 4: Young A6]
Violent goons, vigorous men
Step, tryna drench, put man on the bench
28-inch, don't care if you're hench
Man bore up your sibling, cousin and friend
Glide with the stick or the 9-mm
Tryna feed roadmen hot slugs I'm french
I was on the frontline, you was in bed
Them gems just snap and smoke on blem (Dickhead)
I fuck up the beat and I let waps beat
But the opps take pills 'cah they're way too stressed
Call me a surgeon, I open chests
When I unclip chefs, make a yute digest (Shoo)
There's a blue story and it's tragic
When I see Magic, I'll do him like Vex, vexed
Head, neck, back or chest
When I swing this chets, my intent is death

[Verse 5: Lucii]
I done caught me a case OT
With three rambos and they still got dropped (Why?)
What you know about voodoo?
NFA next day, thank God (Mhm)
Fuck that, no, man know I thank Satan
True say it's blatant, I do it a lot (Satan)
One-two offerings for my God, then rest of the day gets carried on (Oh yeah)
If I hop out the ride with two bankais
Bro, don't run, don't cut (Don't cut)
These swords are twinnin'
I've got two yanks for both of your lungs (Splash)
Man do cowboy with that dudus (Bap)
Grip that firm, chest that at your drum (Bap)
Little man come blocka
Don't be a flocka
Come Milford and you see redrum

[Verse 6: Tzgwala]
Take a shot at the brown, no cat won't frown
Buggin' out like I just made a big man drown (Big man)
Other side of the bridge just clowns
Go ask **** how we ducked him down
Next day Sosa got 'round
With a getback ting and it's clappin' rounds
Had them man doing up burners
'Cah they ain't got no burners (They ain't got none)
Probably ran to his mum like, "Mum, there's a gun"
She's probably like, "Not now, Bernard" (Not now, son)
Man do this for fun
Whole place get tun
We was young when we copped our burners (We were just kids)
One skid to the block, that's purges
Or we might cut through the park, no Burgess (Not over there)
Two man on a one-twos swervin'
Do it on foot or a bruck-down Peugeot

[Verse 1: AK]
I'm a G, I can't get G checked
In the party I step, barbies get wet
I ain't seen brodie in a sec', what the heck?
Why you think I hate the Met?
I don't live my life of regrets
No regrets, open chest
Vio, no-no, I can't accept
Hand tings get pressed if you're on my set

[Verse 2: Monkey]
Four quid in a day, man 'affi invest that, stretch that
If my phone ain't on, I'm bored
I phone up bro tryna slap out headbacks
Normal day if you see us in jet black
But if you ever see me with the gang
And we're dressed like tramps, rudeboy you best get back, get back

[Verse 3: Dimzy]
I love a Glock, dots or the fours
But I might dinner date with a PR
Shouts out bro, he's a 60 gleer
No facemask on, LD and PR
They know who we are, wouldn't wanna be ya
Done make the waps dem sing like Aliyah
We don't mind war like North Korea
Just leave me alone, just let me sort my career

[Verse 4: DopeSmoke]
Are you taking the piss?
Of course we're trying
Why you think half of my batch on the wing?
Age don't matter when you're in them vids
You can still get chinged for runnin' them lips
Jack is shit, he shot and missed
Fill up the dings, let's take a trip
And we're coming equipped

[Verse 5: Silent]
Come round here, and we're going back round
No doubts, guarantee I'm tryna make them drown
Talking a lot while I sort my sounds
It's all fun and games 'til we get them down
Clocked-clocked my prey, jump out and pounced
Got me swinging here now or you might hear bow, bow, bow
Do it and bounce
Yeah, we do it in Fields, yeah, we do it in Town

[Verse 6: Dimzy]
My aqua the best, he's smokey
But he gets devious with that cutter
Two waps up on smoke, thats smoked
And came in a duo and got down Stuttz
Doner kebab when we got down Thumpz
That blade done spread his flesh like butter
Think you're bad in that fuck off jacket
Man will come round there and ruin that puffer

[Verse 7: SJ]
We was on the ends, but the back bit
Testing out bines that we got for the mac clip
In the parkside everyone's active
Real nigga flew, everyone's contracted
That's on my head, not right, I move sick
Just to do me a mad ting
With the .9mm's, do a backflip
With the .442 like a tactic

[Verse 8: Monkey]
More packs pending
Rolled up a 41 when I heard about Glendon
Don't get caught by the guys on the ride
'Cause you might just end up trending
Have your name in your bro-bro's mentions, or bio
You know the gangdem can't sleep on a vio'

[Verse 9: Silent]
These Junction yutes must hate it
All they're taking is L's
They tried drill it and failed
Next week gang-gang sent my man to hell
This is real life, I ain't telling no tales
I've been sitting in jail said time would tell
Remand for an M, I didn't get no bail
I know I ain't telling no tales

[Verse 10: DopeSmoke]
I got a leng one named Rita
I'm feeling her aura, but her attitude stinks
Hop in the dings and swing, ching
Any opp I catch might swim
*** come dead like Reckz
Bro's too reckless, I swear he don't think
And them CT boys are miserable
Why? 'Cah we put S1 in a spliff

[Verse 11: SJ]
Yard man told me "Haffi easy"
I ain't never been no tea leaf
And ya can't tek mans tings like DV
But fuck it, lets be cheeky
'Cah I swear bro bro put a 12 in his face
Made his eye wander like Stevie
And the next man wanna put corn in the man
And his relative was doing my GG

[Verse 12: AK]
*** held two in his back
It was a double tap
He didn't even get to do one lap
This is real rap, no cap, straight up facts
Bad man, don't take backchat
If you ain't with the gang, you could get backstrapped
R6 on the ride, coming like a satnav
We just spotted some guys, it's about to get mad

Fumez the Engineer, Plugged In
Gang
Yo, Charlie, I like this one
92 baby
It's K

[Verse 1: Ksav]
I’ll swing my arm in a figure of 8
Or I won't leave till the whole clip empty
Them boy ain't nothing but paigons
I can see why them boy love envy
I want LV, Prada or Gucci
I might just offend my opps in Fendi
And when juice get spilled like soda
No I won't say no words like Kenny

[Verse 2: Dbo]
My hand ting coming like Corona
If it coughs twice then it's turning you pack
They say that we come like athletes
Circle your block and we do them laps
All out attack tryna get this paigon
All out attack in the fields, don't lack
He thought he was big likе mac
'Till I pulled out this stick tryna swing for backs

[Verse 3: Trapboy BT]
In the bando, no Kay
But I still make K’s from this Lyca sim
Thе jake boys irritate my skin
Can't put me in the bin, no comment, can't sing
Don't sing like 6, don't snitch like 9
Still circle the nine 2 times
With a machine no gym
Tryna put him in the sky
Make an opp boy fly
Get whacked by mine

[Verse 4: Offica]
Where them at, where them dey, where the paigons get?
Make the boy's eyes look like an asian
Man we get round there on any occasion
It ain't a ride out, it's an invasion
And if you fuck with them, it's a simple equation
You're an opp boy, you're a paigon
A ti lo a ti dé, more time when we slide round there its a quick ting, no calculation

[Verse 5: Ksav]
By God’s grace I don't end up a lifer
But I still slide, see me and we’ll ride out
I ying-yang like China, rip 2 Gs
Make them drip like designer
On the block dressed in black like Chyna
Fresh air ones, see me in my sliders
Hopefully I ain't got to remind yous
Up the A and fuck the Niners
I can't stand them boy from the Nine
All they know is tell lies, tell lies
But their main boy got splashed, baptised
And another Nine boy got hospitalised
Any talk on the A get bun
Drills get done by me and the guys
Dbo tryna swing for backs
He can't swing for backs, so they stay inside

[Verse 6: Dbo]
Scar man’s face like Al Pacino
Buck into A and you can hold 2 on the paint, no free throw
Bow, bow, now the gun need reload
Stuck in the trap with one eye open
Hoping the cats don't jugg that kilo
Dbo, fundz you can’t miss me on road
Fundz, 'cause man's got green like Cee-Lo
Bro bro went and bust that gun
I don't think that he’ll bust that case
They say we don't slide to the B
But Foomey’s gaff got smashed, no trace
They left Rexy fighting for his life
On a hospital bed, got chinged broad day
A1 give her dick in her belly, which side is she on?
Ask your paigon bae

[Verse 7: Trapboy BT]
About slide to the B, we slide to the B
How many man got chased by we?
And lil' man Rose got got times 3
All the Niners, watched them flee
Was me and MZ tryna catch them three
Tryna switch it like OT Chi
But I'm in OT tryna make this cheese
I lurked down the B Town strip
I was pissed that he didn't get hit
Tell bro rise that mash and spit
Aim for his top or aim for his wig
I seen bro grab that stick
Bally on his face, he's taking that risk
Let sticks beat like drum kit
Pull up on them and pump it
Tryna let it blow like trumpets
At them muppets

[Verse 8: Offica]
Bro said to hold this stick
Man you need them muscles
He let it spray like Mr Muscles
Chocolate ting from Belgium, Brussels
She wanna go low
Man bring them bottles
Wait, she wanna jiggle and wiggle
This bad B one split in the middle
Leng, bunda come fat, not little
All my girls them sweet like Skittles
Yo, baby, how you move like that?
This gyally wanna arch her back
Go low, limbo, limbo, touch your toe
No Elvis, baby, when I rock and roll
Me and my guys, we flow like the river
Chat loos, get one in your liver
Or maybe your intestine
I got love for my gang, don't test man

[Verse 9: Ksav]
I got washed up opps, it's peak
'Cause you man move gay, that's suttin' like Marvin
Out in the town tryna dish these foods
Ends are hot, but these cats be starving
We score them goals like FIFA
But we don't commentate like Martin
No Taylor when we got down Swift
2 more down, that's no more targets

[Verse 10: Dbo]
I do them in my Nike tracksuit and sliders
I do that there in my LV kicks
Must be the one who's spreading this virus
'Cause everyone knows that my flows too sick
OT flying, we riding
Out on the field tryna catch me a prick
Bando days, we spin 'round driving
Wave this wand in my hand, no wiz

[Verse 11: Trapboy BT]
Ay, I've been in the T with profit
Bruck down buds tryna make that profit
They chat on the net and gossip
A92, we the hottest topic
Shout SS for the pocket rocket
D-B-O got the plug like socket
I been 'round there on a madness
Watch them dash
What happened to the badness?

[Verse 12: Offica]
In the block like awon da oya b’ota
How many points have we scored in the last few weeks?
Meji, merin, mefa
On the ball, 22 on my back like Kaká

Chest and head got dug out

[Verse 3]
I don't even know their young Gs
I don't really care for them (Fuck 'em)
Do your research on your olders
Like I would never ride for them (Never)
One got bullied at school
And the other one used to fancy men (Fish)
They've been yinged up plenty
Like each and every one of them (Woosh)
Ghost, he already got yitched (Yitch that)
A6, he already got yitched (Yitch that)
The other one nearly got yitched
But my man ran off and left his kicks (Dickhead)
Oh yeah, O Melly's a bitch
And my man lies about the life he lives (Fib)
I beg man name one man on his shizz
And tell my man don't get in the mix (Don't do it)

[Verse 4]
They all got demon rhymes (Huh?)
What they know about demon time?
I can show man demon time
When A got-got, it was no surprise (No surprise)
Let me give you some strong advice
Them man there can't defend your life (Never)
Let me give you some strong advice
Them man there can't protect your life (Never)
I can do it in squads or solos (Wah)
I'm mad in my head, gone loco (Crazy)

In Zone 8 tryna cause some hell
Made Philly dance, cut shapes as well
They can't hack beef, so they sing like Adele
War is war and time will tell
Glock 32, no .32 bells
Get well soon if you hold these shells
Youngers to olders scream like girls
Rise this well, that's a dig-up a cell
In Zone 8 tryna cause some hell
Made Philly dance, cut shapes as well
They can't hack beef, so they sing like Adele
War is war and time will tell

Get well soon if you hold these shells
Youngers to olders scream like girls
Rise this well, that's a dig-up a cell

[Verse 1: Mini]
If I crash this car on a glide
Don't worry 'bout your car getting dented
If I jump out, swing my shank
Pierce man's lungs and I fucking meant it
Stack my bread, then I got it invested
Waps on deck, in the Nizz I test it
TP gang from the deepest trenches
Get back where? Get back in them benches
Hold up, wait, I ain't finished this sentence
Four waps up, this Smoke Squad settings
Jump out gang, put the opps on pendants
Fifteen inch, but the Glock's my preference
Five man deep, that's perfect attendance
Why the opps keep hurdling fences?
Don't ask me personal questions
Ching man down, I'm jerking him endless

[Verse 2: Sava]
Blacked out GLA or Mokka
Me and S in a bruck down Honda
Spin that whip if I see me an opper
Call backup, chinged him proper
Samurai sword cuts like a chopper
Roll with the Glock, fill it with copper
Got live corn for an opper
They don't wanna see what I got in my locker
Them man there just talk on the Gram
I get 'round there in a ding-dong van
Looking for him or a so-called fan
Slide that door, young G go ham
Pray that the .44 ting don't jam
Rate that aim 99, no Sam
I'm on the opp block tryna rise and tan
I'm on the opp block tryna rise and tan

[Verse 3: BM]
I got bare gyal 'round, jiggy-jiggy on deck
In Broadwater Farm got the jiggy on deck
In Tangy Estate got the blicky and kweff
O way or no way, he still get cheffed
Don't move right, you will get left
Shots get beat from the 9 and TEC
Baddie, baddie give drops in West
Flick it, flick it, that's blades in necks
Who's that? My man throwing up O's
You can get left like the Christmas ghost
Drugs, money, it come from the coast
White like Tommy and brown like Saint Patrick
Niggas get lit like I'm lighting my matches
Shots get sent, we don't wait for no catches
Fresh out the box and it's automatic
Tell the driver "Stop here, let me slap it"

[Verse 4: Mini]
I'm on the backroad, I'm on my Jack Jones
But still we crash corn at them
I beg you don't leave your friend
Six feet deep where the opps get sent
Shit gets peak and I know they're stressed
'Cah the OTP's got loaded skengs
Spin that whip, try catch me an M
Tell my young G's don't lack like Dezz'

[Verse 5: Sava]
Two-litre ride, let's go on a glide
Shit gets peak when us man ride
In my mother's hood where my opps get fried
Known to the pigs as a violent guy
You best not lack, got my zombie knife
Got no waps, so the rap is a lie
Invest in shanks, still don't ride
Kidnap squad, don't rap no lies

[Verse 6: BM]
Who's that? What's that?
Jump out, get him
In the Nizz with a rusty weapon
Two AK's, put the 4 in the 7
Have you ever seen a golden berettan?
Slap that corn at his melon
Slide tru' with the Wesson
Question, question
Why the fuck are you leaving your bredrin?

[Chorus: BM]
In Zone 8 tryna cause some hell
Made Philly dance, cut shapes as well
They can't hack beef, so they sing like Adele
War is war and time will tell
Glock 32, no .32 bells
Get well soon if you hold these shells
Youngers to olders scream like girls
Rise this well, that's a dig-up a cell
In Zone 8 tryna cause some hell
Made Philly dance, cut shapes as well
They can't hack beef, so they sing like Adele
War is war and time will tell
Glock 32, no .32 bells
Get well soon if you hold these shells
Youngers to olders scream like girls
Rise this well, that's a dig-up a cell

Knockout's juice gets spilled on the floor (Pussy)
Huh, now you done started a war
No ping-pong, gang cuttin' tru' Burgess back and forth (Ping)

Nowhere near where his mumzy lives

[Verse 3: Trizzac]

My blade hit his chest-plate
Next day, swear, I had his best friend runnin' (Kevin)
I done beat up Rampz in probation
He shouldn't have pushed my buttons
Why'd you think that they call me Judas?
I laugh and giggle at my dead opp cousin (Incog)
Loose says that he chings, he doesn't (No)
Trust me, gang done cheffed up dozens (Ching)
I'm tryna see the opps get shot (Bow)
Same way GB done got-got (Bow, bow)
Or how CJ done got dropped (Ching)
Surely dem man has had enough? (They have)
But trust me, the beef don't stop (No)
So we're out 'ere tryna put another in the box
I done beat up Jimmy before he turn dust
Twins and Loski watched Naghz get chopped (Shameless)

[Verse 4: BGody]
On the ride, bro pass that hammer
Rock and roll 'til the drum Mick Jagger
It don't matter, twenty-one years

Then it's back to the slammer, soc' and bang up (Scratch him up)
If I scratch this yout', no mask

Trizz, rise up things
Swing that shit, I know his intent was murder
Reverse that whip
It might be flizz, but I'll do it and burn that drip (Burner)
Me, LV, jailhouse pissed
Still cut a man up or we'll swing our fists
And I swear on my life, even govs got hit
That day that we got down Chris

[Verse 5: LR]
Rage got smoked like 'Dam
And his dad got splashed
Come ride, like damn (Splash)
Same day Loose got bored on his block
Loose tried dash, they shoulda got cramp
He ain't got one, how the hell's he rappin’?
He jumped off third floor, we got your lad
Ain’t-ain't got a suitcase when we be packin’
Like Tiny knows, had his flesh on our shanks (Yo)
Ask when I slapped that lead
They're lucky I missed, shoulda turned man pack
Fuck these ratchets, I need me a hot girl
Would've thought that her name's Katie Pam
Their boy got slapped and it wasn't with hands
Dingers or peds, what I'm into Milan
Rep 3x3, grab the .9, let it bang
If I see any graves, know I'm pissin’ on that

[Verse 6: Kwengface]
(Yo-Yo) Deqwan got bored in his arm real quick
‘Cah the boy tried to cover his tizzac
Mars-Mars-Mars got cheffed by the W Street
True say it was me that did that (Get them both)
Rage is dead, SK's dead
All now none of us man been packed (Ugh)

[Verse 1: Monkey]
Same way I cut shapes in the rave
I dip, dip, dip in man's face
Niggas know how we got down Daze
Them scars had him looking like a slave
I do it like my broski Skeng
Fuck legs, all I wanted was a face
No face, no case
Sut-Suttin go dead up today
Whiz round, put a nigga in his place
Doing drive-bys, hitting no one, bruh that's a waste
Ten toes on the block with the gang hella times on the pave
Make blood spill, not 'Gnac when I step on your pave
More money, more problems were words from Biggie and Ma$e
Maze in my hand when I step, no case, no trace
Skeng to your mouth like maud, like that's some paste
With the smoke I'm smoking, chilling with the gang in the rave

[Chorus: LD]
Wanna take it there? We can take it there
Skeng in a four door truck, opp block, take it there
Bro's got both in O, you know he's gonna rake it there
Most of the team in jail, still getting paid in there
Niggas know how we got down Daze, how you gonna make it fair?
Same way we got down Capo, you could never make it fair
Wanna take it there? We can take it there
Skeng in a four door truck, opp block, take it there
Opp block take it there

[Verse 2: Dimzy]
My phone line's jumpy
I gave a hooker the D's years back and she's still tryna bug me
I can move grub on the ends but I love it in country
I got serious hooters, they're way too dumpy
Got a Chopper, some spinners and dumpies
My sister's lovely
She said "Do this music ting, man, lowe all the fuckery"
I do road on some serious guys, man serious monkeys
Feds at my mum's door, tryna do man some fuckery
Cause I'll crash for my bro, don't judge me
Trap, trap, trap
My phone went slow, so I done footwork on the map
My name ring bells, try me, catch bells in your back
I love my lil' bro like Maddix, big fat skeng in his rusty bag

[Chorus: LD]
Wanna take it there? We can take it there
Skeng in a four door truck, opp block, take it there
Bro's got both in O, you know he's gonna rake it there
Most of the team in jail, still getting paid in there
Niggas know how we got down Daze, how you gonna make it fair?
Same way we got down Capo, you could never make it fair
Wanna take it there? We can take it there
Skeng in a four door truck, opp block, take it there
Opp block take it there

[Verse 3: ASAP]
I came back from the trap
My clothes and my socks are smelling all mad
But I do it for the bands
Skeng in a 4 door truck
Tryna smoke dem man
They say smoking kills but the mandem still do drills, it's mad
Opp block, take it there
2 skengs in an automatic, we ain't playing fair
12 Gauge makes a mad noise, spins on my side like a cowboy
The streets are cold and we're holding poles
You can hold the smoke from this 9 boy
Free the guys and fuck the pigs
I'm in the trap house taking loads of risks
I love my drillers, they take loads of risks
The same way you'll blow for me, I'll blow for Scribz

[Chorus: LD]
Wanna take it there? We can take it there
Skeng in a four door truck, opp block, take it there
Bro's got both in O, you know he's gonna rake it there
Most of the team in jail, still getting paid in there
Niggas know how we got down Daze, how you gonna make it fair?
Same way we got down Capo, you could never make it fair
Wanna take it there? We can take it there
Skeng in a four door truck, opp block, take it there
Opp block take it there

Pull up, pop, slap
Jump out gang, it was us that did that (Bap, bap)

I saw yutes over there on the grass
But it's only civis just doin' up footy
Bro nearly stepped and did that fully (Whoosh)
If I pull that shank from my ass
Flick that in your face, now I call a man shitface
The whole of your gang is a mistake
Rejects, whole of your gang is a disgrace (Nah, 'low it man)
I can talk about drillings and chingings (I can talk)
Man jumped out the whip with my shank in my hand
Mad ting while the wheels still spinnin' (Mad)
Mum said that I keep on sinnin'
All I know is drugs, money and women ('Low me)
Plus I love shottys and spinners (Woo)
I make money off streams and sales
Now I'm tryna buy waps and dingers
Talk on my name then you got some nerve ('Low it)
Two hands on the .9, two hands on the spin
Either way, watch your gang disperse
Shanked him down by Warren Street
Damn, should have put him in a hearse
Lettin' it rip, beatin' off sticks
First on my block, man I did that first
Ran down GB and I ran down Tizzy (Woo-woo)
I don't know who's faster
Still tryna ching then head to the Zones
With the loudest zoots and the loudest laughter
Shave man's head, comin' like one barber (Aye)

Hollow
Yo, it's Plugged In
Big up Fumez the Engineer
AM, Skengdo, Likkle Rass
410, Crash
You know how it gets, free all the mandem
Ay, dududu

[Verse 1: AM]
Stepped there and we turned it off
Say mum's life you ain't heard of us
We got drug dealers and murderers
410 to the world y'know (Fuckin' hell)
Hella corn we're servin' up
Leave a keloid not a hernia
I'm a mad man I do mad things
This hand ting's from Serbia
Peng tings wanna link me and I'm paro (Paro)
I got mad thoughts to put good use to this ammo (Dududu)
Send 'nuff bine through your marrow
'Cause I'm clued up, you can't diss me (No)
Tryna lie man, I'll set pitbulls on your pickney
Your bitch doin' up pick me to get digged out, do you dig me?
On my mum's life they ain't trickin' me (No)
Literally, I've got two tings from Italy, that's a bit of me
Got side niggas tryna drain me for my energy
Grey Goose not Hennessy
On the G ting, what you tellin' me?
'Cause a bad boy, you'll never be (Never)
If you fuck with them, you're an enemy (Enemy)
C'est la vie, I took more buns from Melanie
That's a mad gyal from secondary (Fuckin' hell)
Pullin' up now 'round Tennessee's (Dudu)
It's my birthday, what you gettin' me?
Big guns what it better be
'Cause I'm in the streets, heavily (Mally)

[Verse 2: Skengdo]
Stretch him, stretch him, see man back out this fuck-off weapon
Everyone thinks they're bad, mad
Boy don't come to my section (Don't do it)
The Gs them resting, 4am
Tell me, who are you gettin? (Who?)
Man didn't learn their lesson
The boy shh-shh and they out 'ere flexin' (Shh-shh)
The things I've seen man do for attention
Why does my name get mentioned?
Tem man there want love and affection
Chat to the girls all reckless (Chaty)
Pop corn like we pop smoke
Do it like perm when we back our wetters (Dududu-dududu, bow)
I hate when a man talks hella
You know you ain't like that fella

[Verse 3: Lil Rass]
On the ride with Paulo, handbrakes skiddin'
I spotted a opp from a distance(Skrrr)
It wasn't me that did him, my bro that did him, all I know is he got did in (Wet dat, wet dat)
I see a man try run and cover his head
He didn't know that corn can penetrate (Baw)
Double tap make him levitate, take on a heavyweight
Lift up a man, make him elevate
Their friend got flung in a riz, chip
And they talk on the team, that's whack
You can catch me out on my block
Serving out packs out of council flats
I ain't gotta question bro-bro's badness
I ain't gotta tell him to bring them waps
If you see them yutes, it's straight on-sight
Just drop what you're doin' and attack (Baw-baw)

[Verse 4: Skengdo]
Late-night lurk with the Gs
Who's that? Who's that? Juice this fella
Or, du-du-du bow bow bow, the ting got rose like Nella (Baw-baw)
Just pull it back like foreskin, make your bro go pick your head up (Dududu-dududu)
See I'm fed up, the opps be talkin'
Like the boys ain't dead up
Sick and tired of the foolishness
Broski's feelin' the same way (He is)
See man sippin' on Wray-Wray
That's his last ray-ray for the day-day (True)
Carryin' things same size as me
No we ain't comin' to play-play (We ain't)
If I swing this shit, ching this prick
Watch man do up the nae-nae

[Verse 5: Lil Rass]
Shotgun come short like D9 (Baw)
ZK come long like Renten
Buck into me, I'll dice and blend men
Do drills and they go unmentioned (True)
Ching yutes and they go unmentioned (True)
Old-school days, it was flickies and pushbikes
Get 'round there tryna leave them ended
Heat in my hand, ignite 'em (Grrr)
Spin that wap like Dyson (Baw)
I ain't down with the fightin' Tyson
Headshots put a loud mouth boy silent (Shhh)
Critical damage when I got that victim
I'm gassed that he didn't start snitchin' (Snitch boy)
Should've seen the way that I ripped him
Tear through tops when I score with precision

[Verse 6: AM]
Niggas in the front, niggas in the back
Headshot, Diddy bop, put him in the bag (Dudu)
If a nigga lack then we put him in the grave
We ain't hoppin' out the ride to bang them in the face (No)
We ain't hoppin' out the ride to put it in a rib (Baw-baw)
Head shot, Diddy bop, put him in a spliff (Dududu)
Done what I done so it is what it is
You won't last for a day if you live where I live, no cap
And the bud same colour as Barney
'Ready knows it, I ain't a Yardie
Baby don't ask "where have you gone?" though (Don't ask)
You can still call me when you're on me (Calm)
You get linked in the night like Bongo
You ain't gonna see day like rondo
Had a blue shirt lookin' at Barclays (Dududu)
Put a red line through it like Congo (Mally)

[Intro: Lil Rass]
Jester made this
Fumez The Engineer
Grrr, bow
Plugged In

[Verse 1: Lil Rass, Skengdo & AM]
I get called up when they need that gunman
Grrr, bun men
If I clocked him, I woulda tried dump ten
Put him in a box, make him rest with his dumb friend
Opp boys talk, but they do not ride
It's a shame, 'cah their boy did die
We made Lambeth hot, two weeks in a row, bro
Go check out the news, two of dem turned yea (Bububu, bow)
This ain't UFC when I swing these hands, it's a shave
I grip, get dipped (Ching, ching)
Them man know we the opps
So I'm lost, why they dipping innocent kids? (I'm lost)
If this corn hits him, his mum will be pissed
Broski's down for the cause
His shank don't bend, the ZK going straight in
Or put him in two like the 16 kid
Life of the net, 'cause your works ain't legit (Dudududu)
Man run when I rise that midget
Buckshot corn, head back, man fill it
Sku-dud, bow, dead, finished (Bow, bow, bow, bow)
I can't sleep when the demons visit
They get scared in the night, I fidget (Scared)
Why you lie when you know who did it?
I sku-dud and dudu, rise and kill him

[Verse 2: BM & Mini]
In the Polo, switch that to a Volvo
They see our face and they keep it go-go
No Mojo when I buck into Jojo
Big tools there like I work in Selco
It's 'cause they think it’s Sunday when they hear these bells go
This ain't church or COD (Nah)
It’s a World War 3
Come outside, fuck a hide and seek
Fuck a hideout, we rideout
They claim they’re OJ, let's find out
She wants to change me from this lifestyle
Don't hate me, blame me for the nights out
On the opp block, parked up with the lights out
Creep up close and he knows it's time now
We died nine out, now this beef can't die out
He got shaved and saved like his iCloud
Triple 9, its an emergency, civilians screaming out "Stay with me"
Step on the gas, can't stop for police
No, it weren’t done by no Wolverine
Air ambulance, don't glizz at the scene
Can't say names, but they know what I mean
Pull up and beat, drill and repeat
Can't go home 'til the mission's complete

[Verse 3: Lil Rass, Skengdo & AM]
You know I can't sleep on vios
I don't care how long it takes
Someone's gonna end up in an Insta bio
It was me at the start of the year tryna keep that trend of a new opp packing
I've had enough of splash and bragging
We splash man down and laugh at the damage
Do it for the 4's, yeah, I do it for the dads
Don't do it for the hoes, yeah, I do it for the bag
Bro said it don't work, I made it bang
Ask Juice 'bout the juice we had (Dudududududu, bow)
Pissed, caught me an opp boy, Rass said "Lowe him", so I had to lowe the twat (Allowed him)
It's crash, put this one in your back, have your mandem pouring yak (Oh, man)
Man got blick like he’s darker than me
You ain’t half of a G, you can’t bargain with me (Eurgh)
Bruck that back, come arch it for me
I got artillery, it’s not hard to believe (It's not hard)
The corn missed man like marginally
When we send that back (Eurgh), that’s a face on a tee
I’m waiting for man, he ain’t waiting for me
Try wet man’s legs like he’s taking a pee

[Verse 4: Rack5, TY & M'Skum]
(Blu-blu-bluuwuu)
The gun silence good in the vid (Brrr)
But he ain’t ever took that risk (Bow, bow)
Of course she fucks with the Crips, this bad bitch from the 156 (She wid it)
You told her your blade goes in, but it’s still virgin like a Catholic bitch (Shh, shh, shh)
On the phone and this bad pipin'
I think that the Trident tapped my sim (Where they at?)
Rack5 pulled up in a ride, so me and JSav hopped in for the glide
Tryna drill man bait with my migos on a Friday with about five guys (Where they at?)
I can’t leave no trace like AJ, it’s a mayday if I let that rise (Woi-woi)
Shotgun come side by side, could saw that bait on a 125
King of the five plus five but my heart’s with the double one (Eleven)
You don’t wanna see Seedorf lurking with the .44, that’s a lethal gun (Bow, bow)
Shit, splash-splash up the opps for fun (Shit, splash)
Free up my croski Horrid1
10 bop with TY, I find it fun (Ching)
Rip through coats, that’s punctured lungs (Ching, ching)
And they ain’t never touched my skin
But the opps dem know what I done did (Holla)
Fernando, I can’t lie like him
I know you heard 'bout Wizz, you can die like him (Dead up)
So, now it’s minus him
Pass the backwood and now I’m lighting him
How the opps got time to diss? They be getting wiped out like the virus did
I got put on the wing with opps, I still stepped out with a ching in my sock
Most man would’ve rid that vovo, not the Volvo you see parked on the block (No)
Had 5 man up in the dock, Mum shocked when she saw that sword in my prop (Pissed)
Yo it’s ten stone time in block, I step to your mosque with a rock in my sock
Had to breach curfew to do that drill (I did)
I love the thrill
Me and Sav too real, tryna make juice spill (Splash)
I don’t know how the paigons feel
But I know they get done up and bun for real
I’m a real badman, I ain’t got no chill (Mhm)
When I step over there it’s to kill, 'cause this beef gets fucking real

[Verse: Russ]
Pull up in a party with my chargie
No paparazzi, I'm with my army

Cah my hair's coolie she thinks I'm Mali
Up front like Vardy, shoot at the crowd
Hide your barbie
Badman don't suck punani
Man suck them breasts and mek her horny
Need to hit that one more time
Old ting but the pum pum's mine
I'm with Wayne now she thinks I'm 9
That's my killy, bro, my slime
Spin the block, yo take that right
Stretch my arm and let one fly
Back my ting, rudeboi don't hide
Copper lead clip filled with binе
Killy with a millie get busy
She wan' gеt friggy 'pon willy get giddy
Real badman, can't tek me for Billy
Ya see me, kilikilikilikeh habibti
For the culture like Trick and Lippy
Do my dance like Shiggy
Show my gun lean now she wan' get friggy
Shorty said "Russ you're way too litty"
And let me keep it real, tell me who else went plat off drill
Love a browning like Zeze Millz
Takin' my shot, go straight for the kill
Unless it make sense can't sign no deal
Don't get your head back peeled
Operate the ting with skill
Pull up on me and you might get drilled
But, I never worked in retail
Got like a hundred bookings in my email
AMIRI jeans, yeah she love the detail
Run them down and I love their females
Gassed, gassed up like petrol
Real bad man from the ghetto
Hear the sound of that echo
Bullet blow out your marrow
R-U-Double S
North gyal's pum pum's the best
10/10, uck's excellent
Yeng yeng, man creep and kweng
Make your car dash like 'shian
War ready like Talibans
In the field like Afghanistan
808 kick like Jackie Chan

Tek that tek that he couldn't tek that
I should've just digged out his head back (Dig it)

[Verse 2: Russ]
Spliff in my mouth (Bill it)
Gun on my hip (Bullet)
One in the clip (Shotta)
I might Dior your chick
Clocked her gram and she liked my pic
Cutest face and she nice and thick
That's your BM, she's in my DMs
Can't take man for a punk like CM

[Verse 3: Buni]
Numerous man got ripped
Shit, next time get bun in your wig
He nearly got bun in his wig
Pissed, bare man just runnin' and shit (Dashing)
Badman ain't havin' that shit
When we see one of dem I'm lettin' it rip (Rip it)
There ain't no settlin' this
I'm OTT when I step in with this

[Verse 4: Russ]
Generators and shanks, love my fam
Gyal, I mek bands
Baby drive the boat with no hands
She love my dance, she said I'm lit
I like the way she's moving her hips
Control her two hands on her -
If she a bad bitch give her this dick
Tik tok tik whinin' on it

[Verse 5: Buni]
Two skengs, two man on a glide
Wave that dot-dots side to side (Bang)
I don't wanna hear about the other side
Cah the other side don't come outside (They don't)
The last time that they came outside
One got cheffed and left outside
Real bad man, gyal feel my vibe
When I stretch my arm that's a crucify (Bang)

[Verse 6: Russ]
Tekky, your mandem ready
Shoot man's head or ching man's belly (Bullet)
Big batty, big batty shake like jelly
I'm too gassed up, gassed up like petty (Bullet)
Really out here for the readies
But if they wan' smoke come armed and ready (Shotta)
Two hands on a skeng, steady (Shotta)
Aim up high, I don't want no leggy

[Verse 7: Buni]
Been hearin' my name a lot
It's all fun and games 'til my loadout drops
Don't slip or you're holdin' shots
If you hang with them then you're holdin' shots (Boy)
Man bully up any man's block
Rock with the dots, turn any man off
Badman turned many man off
Two yellow cards gon' send a man off (Gone)

[Verse 8: Russ]
Man a real skeng man
Ead not good man a real madman (Madman, madman)
Real life stepper
Ring ding ding get the pum pum wetter
Skin get bun
Gonna do Russ, tell the paigons come (Come,c ome)
This shit's fun
Sloppy top, two balls on her tongue (Bad)
All the girls in the world man love them
But if they fuck with opps then fuck them (Fuck them)
Pumpin', man stay round winners and gunmen (Bang)
Poke them because I done them
Like big tits but I prefer the bumdem (Shake it, shake it)
Come shake your booty for Russ then (Shake it, shake it)
Shake your booty for Russian

[Intro]
Turn me up KidSpyral
Ghosty
Bow!

[Verse 1: Nikz]
Bad one bust down on the kid, come arch her
I tell her go low for the A92 (Buss it)
I'm scorching in this T, no T Rex
And he got run out the A by fiends (Ching, ching)
I'm a young black boy tryna slap this lead
And I bun hella green buds with the crew
I made man's white tee turn red
Now I'm wanted by the boys in blue
Winnin' this beef and I say it with chest
Now I got a mask on my face like COVID
Slap one at a pagan's chest
And now you got a pain in your chest like COVID
We don't play like duck-duck-goose
I duck a man down, tryna leave man folded (Baow)
If you don't duck, get hit in your Canada Goose
You know the gangdem's loaded
They ain't out on the block so wе circle around
Yeah, we circlе like a merry-go-round
You ain't ever tryna get a bag or a body
Get a body bag, I use it when I pull up in the town
I ain't ever lied, did I do that, I'd die in the station
You know a nigga holdin' it down
Fly out the ride tryna ying that yuh, yuh
I'm really tryna yurk man down
We got down ****, we got down ****, we got down ****, we got down ****
I don't even wanna talk 'bout roses
Girl's been passed all around like Rondo (Jezzie)
Go low for the gang, just go low
Done it on a two man, step or solo
Only live once, that's YOLO, YOLO
Do it like bando, screamin' out yo

[Chorus: Offica]
I'm an artist, but when the beef gets hot, you cannot decline
And I've said it time to time, the beef is stupid, I won't deny
But it is what it is, see, the A got beef with the Nine
And just when I thought this beef was dead
Bro came with the seasonin' and kicked off and it started again
When they slide 'round here, we slide right back
We're tryna do more than just get even
But if you roll with us and you fuck with them, you're committin' treason
Asked for the motive, she said, "In my bedroom"
Now I got her screamin', "Opor" gyallie on me, man
Says she want more
Go low, go low, all the way to the floor

[Verse 2: Kebz]
Mi wan slap corn in a pagan's door
Get 'round there in a four-by-four
Uh, uh, j'adore, j'adore
When I get man down, it's a round of applause (Uh-uh)
And I don't really get no sleep
Cah I'm dishin' out packs like Santa Claus (Way)
Shorties work out for the team
Go low, go low, all the way to the floor
Slide 'round there, no cha cha, slide **** and **** got hopped two times (Yeah)
Young G's wan' go on the glide
Just move to the right, let me hop inside (Hop)
If bae bae don't give us the drop
So I guess what's yours is also mine (Haha)
Now it's back to the trap one time
Cah the pack come sweet like Caroline

[Verse 3: Ksav]
Yo, bad one, arch it (Uh-uh)
Go low for the gang, that's perfect (Baow, baow)
We'll put it in R and park it
Spin that coupe as the B go blast it
Tryna get more Ms like Huncho (I am)
So my reputation ain't tarnished (Ain't tarnished)
And free my guys that's locked in the bin
Them boy ain't trash like garbage (You know)
Broski's got P and I've got P
So I guess we're tryna get richer (Ooh, ooh)
Bae bae was down for me
So I guess I'll giver her this D like Digga (92 baby)
They don't bang on the A, they're fibbers
When they come, man, they take snaps like pictures
On the M24s like the GBGs
But we don't dance with hittas

[Chorus: Offica]
I'm an artist, but when the beef gets hot, you cannot decline
And I've said it time to time, the beef is stupid, I won't deny
But it is what it is, see, the A got beef with the Nine
And just when I thought this beef was dead
Bro came with the seasonin' and kicked off and it started again
When they slide 'round here, we slide right back
We're tryna do more than just get even
But if you roll with us and you fuck with them, you're committin' treason
Asked for the motive, she said, "In my bedroom"
Now I got her screamin', "Opor" gyallie on me, man
Says she want more
Go low, go low, all the way to the floor

Plugged In with Fumez, 98 crew
Slatt, lemonade
R14
Mmm, ayy come 'ere

[Verse 1: Stally & V9]
98, that's my fucking number
Clip long like cucumber
Make it rain, beat off that thunder
Get chinged out your fucking jumper
Rideouts daily, we live in the field
Glide with the stainless steel
This wap ain't fake, it's real
I feed man bine, watch your boy get peeled
Active crasher, peek when I pop up
Swing my sword with mans top up
Anything I do, I do it for the blocka
When we sliding yeah we suit up proper
Chase a man down, let it beat (Ayy come here), gotcha
Unlimited shells for a opper
Smell the gunpowder when I slap this wapper

[Verse 2: Mazza]
Mazza, I don't know how it got to this
I'm deep and really gonna rock this quick
Ain't got a problem copping sticks
Need more gyal to lock this shit
Chilling in the crowds, peak, don't get hit, don't get hit
Run a man down and wet it
98 bitch, don't ever forget it
It's us man doing it man stop hating
Doing it early, free up Gauges
Fuck the net, us man do blaze it
Armed and ready, nuttin' to play with
Talking badness, show me some faces
You ain't on, I can see it's blatant
Close to the dot, watch brodie face him

[Verse 3: Billy Billions]
Buck into opps and they ducking and diving
These niggas be hiding
The handy be spitting out final fighting
Thunder and lightning
We dishing out corn for these oppers that's typing
And talking to trident
Shushing and wooshing, I'm on nothing but violence
Drilling in silence
Bitch, I'm really hood famous
Still armed and dangerous
My mum told me I'mma make it, my plug told me "Be patient"
In the dinger with the rollers
I'mma shooter so I’m chauffeured
Automatic with the toasters
Lick your head of your shoulders

[Verse 4: DA]
Who do you think's terrorising Hackney?
Let's lurk, lemme throw these two L's down
And until then, unhappy
They love to mad me so I'm on backstreets
Tryna mix one with baccy
Plan B, get on the bike, get stabby
Now it's the 3 double O's with the machines
Free up Matic, he love get crashy
Trap in my hood, get charged like batteries
Late night shifts out of maxis
She would text me just to let man bag b
I'm at the border, not where it's sandy
So don't get caught in the middle
BG get to work with the chizzle
Ran out of film, we ain't making a movie
Now I'm filling my bag with bags from Lidl

[Verse 5: Stally]
In the dinger burning tires
98s, we're real riders
Bitch I'm Wee Bey from the wire
Up this burner, let it fire
Jump out the ride, I don't window watch
Man dump the clip and then I skrr off
Went guilty early, got a third off
I whip white and get dirt gone

[Verse 6: Mazza]
Really got dirt all over the trap
Looking like Leigh on sea
Got magg all in this batch, I'm trappy, capital T
Lee said get in a load
Stop phoning my phone for free
There are stacks in the drawer
Close the blinds, let me count these p's

[Verse 7: Billy Billions]
I still fuck up the re for these waps
Still hide all the keys in the flats
My niggas tell me I'm tapped
I still let it beat off the max
I got snakes aiming at my back
Mix the runtz with the wax
Keep it fully auto on attack
Free my fucking nigga Smash

[Verse 8: DA]
Circle back, get caught on a rebound
Shot or shaved then your holding a beatdown
Jakes at the frontdoor, backdoor, creep out
Baked off, hoping one of them boy bleed out
Feed man corn when they eat out
Problem with the 9 or 8 don't speak out
Silence slug shots sneak out
Anywhere gang know man might reroute

[Verse 9: Stally, Mazza, Billy Billions & DA]
Man tried stay when the mash got brandished
You heard one shot, next thing he vanished
The corn cause some panic
It's tragic holes in and out mans jacket
Holes in and out mans jacket
9 and 8 in your hood don't panic
Slap it, slap it, bredrin ran, you're static
Vanish magic
With the glee I'm erratic
Extended clip cinematic
Zig Zou all metallic
Slap it out the panoramic
When I'm controlling, I'm ecstatic
I'm with a tool like a mechanic
Or in a pyrex mode and ceramics
Drain it, dry it, tag it, slang it
Fill up this gun, I ain't filling up petty
I need metal and teeth like braces
I ain't tryna catch no cases
Fling some shots to the face like faces
Man I'll light up your block like Vegas
Really do on a regular basis
You left in numerous mazes
Humorous paigons, none of them dangerous

[Outro: KO & V9]
Yeah, yeah, come on man, you already know what's going on
Class of 98s out right now, gangs the hardest out
Come on man, you know
Fumez the Engineer
Mmm, ayy come 'ere
